If it wasn’t\\nfor the conversations we had, the thoughts you shared in your writings, and the\\nhistories and statistics that you dug out from archives, this book would have not\\nbeen possible. In some cases you are still with us and in some cases you are not,\\nbut you are all in my thoughts. I am especially grateful to Henry Kissinger, Wang\\nQishan, Graham Allison, Lee Kuan Yew, Liu He, Paul Volcker, Mario Draghi,\\nPaul Kennedy, Richard N.

I am grateful to Mark Kirby above all others for his unwavering\\ndevotion, talent, and patience. I am also grateful to Michael Kubin, Arthur\\nGoldwag, and Phil Revzin, who all provided helpful comments on the\\nmanuscript, and to Jim Levine, my literary agent, and Jo\\x00e Ferrari-Adler, my\\neditor, who helped create this book and get it out there.\\nBeyond these people were many others, including Gardner Davis, Udai\\nBaisiwala, Jordan Nick, Michael Savarese, Jonathan Bost, Stephen McDonald,\\nElena Gonzalez Malloy, Khia Kurtenbach, Alasdair Donovan, Floris Holstege,\\nAnser Kazi, Chris Edmonds, Julie Farnie, and Brian De Los Santos, whocontributed signi\\x00cantly behind the scenes—as did all the people at Bridgewater,\\nwho together created the most amazing learning platform imaginable.HOW TO READ THIS BOOK\\nIn writing this book I wrestled with whether to make it complete or concise\\nand decided to try to make it both by bolding passages to create a quick-\\nread version. If you want to read the concise version, read what is in\\nbold, and if you want more, it’s all available to you.\\nI also wanted to convey some principles that are timeless and universal\\ntruths for dealing with reality well, which I denoted by \\n putting a r ed dot in\\nfront of them and italicizing .\\nFor some subjects, I had embellishments that I thought would be\\ninteresting to some but not all readers, so I chose to present them as an\\naddendum to the respective chapter. Feel free to read or skip as you like.\\nAt the back of this book, you can \\x00nd a glossary that explains the\\nabbreviations you see in some of the charts.\\nFinally, to keep this book from becoming much too long, there is also a lot\\nof supplemental material available at economicprinciples.org, including\\nreference material, citations, more data on the indices, etc.INTRODUCTION\\nThe times ahead will be radically di\\x00erent from those we’ve experienced\\nin our lifetimes, though similar to many times in history.\\nHow do I know that? Because they always have been.\\nOver the last 50 or so years, in order to handle my responsibilities well, I have\\nneeded to understand the most important factors that go into making countries\\nand their markets succeed and fail. I learned that to anticipate and handle\\nsituations that I had never faced before I needed to study as many analogous\\nhistorical cases as possible to understand the mechanics of how they transpired.\\nThat gave me principles for dealing with them well.\\nA few years ago, I observed the emergence of a number of big\\ndevelopments that hadn’t happened before in my lifetime but had\\noccurred numerous times in history. Most importantly, I was seeing the\\ncon\\x00uence of huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates that led to massive\\nprinting of money in the world’s three major reserve currencies; big political and\\nsocial con\\x00icts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth,\\npolitical, and values gaps in roughly a century; and the rising of a new world\\npower (China) to challenge the existing world power (the US) and the existing\\nworld order. The most recent analogous time was the period from 1930 to 1945.\\nThis was very concerning to me.\\nI knew that I couldn’t really understand what was happening and deal\\nwith what would be coming at me unless I studied past analogous\\nperiods, which led to this study of the rises and declines of empires, their\\nreserve currencies, and their markets. In other words, to develop an\\nunderstanding of what is happening now and might happen over the\\nnext few years, I needed to study the mechanics behind similar cases inhistory—e.g., the 1930–45 period, the rise and fall of the Dutch and\\nBritish empires, the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties, and others.1 I was\\nin the midst of doing those studies when the COVID-19 pandemic struck,\\nwhich was another one of those big events that never happened in my lifetime\\nbut had happened many times before. Past pandemics became a part of this\\nstudy and showed me that surprising acts of nature—e.g., diseases, famines, and\\n\\x00oods—need to be considered as possibilities because those surprising big acts of\\nnature that rarely come along were by any measure even more impactful than the\\nbiggest depressions and wars.\\nAs I studied history, I saw that it typically transpires via relatively\\nwell-de\\x00ned life cycles, like those of organisms, that evolve as each\\ngeneration transitions to the next. In fact, the history and the future of\\nhumanity can be seen as just the aggregate of all the individual life stories\\nevolving through time. I saw these stories \\x00ow together as one all-encompassing\\nstory from the beginning of recorded history up to this moment, with the same\\nthings happening over and over again for basically the same reasons, while still\\nevolving. By seeing many interlinking cases evolve together, I could see the\\npatterns and cause/e\\x00ect relationships that govern them and could\\nimagine the future based on what I learned. These events happened many\\ntimes throughout history and were parts of a cycle of rises and declines of\\nempires and most aspects of empires—e.g., of their education levels, their\\nlevels of productivity, their levels of trade with other countries, their militaries,\\ntheir currencies and other markets, etc.\\nEach of these aspects or powers transpired in cycles, and they were all\\ninterrelated. For example, nations’ levels of education a\\x00ected their levels of\\nproductivity, which a\\x00ected their levels of trade with other countries, which\\na\\x00ected the levels of military strength required to protect trade routes, which\\ntogether a\\x00ected their currencies and other markets, which a\\x00ected many other\\nthings. Their movements together made up the economic and political cycles\\nthat occurred over many years—e.g., a very successful empire or dynasty could\\nhave its cycle last 200 or 300 years. All the empires and dynasties I studied\\nrose and declined in a classic Big Cycle that has clear markers that allow\\nus to see where we are in it.This Big Cycle produces swings between 1) peaceful and prosperous\\nperiods of great creativity and productivity that raise living standards a\\nlot and 2) depression, revolution, and war periods when there is a lot of\\n\\x00ghting over wealth and power and a lot of destruction of wealth, life,\\nand other things we cherish. I saw that the peaceful/creative periods lasted\\nmuch longer than the depression/revolution/war periods, typically by a ratio of\\nabout 5:1, so one could say that the depression/revolution/war periods were\\ntransition periods between the normally peaceful/creative periods.\\nWhile the peaceful/creative periods are certainly more enjoyable for most\\npeople, all these realities have their purposes for advancing evolution, so in the\\nbroader sense they are neither good nor bad. The depression/revolution/war\\nperiods produce a lot of destruction, but like cleansing storms, they also get rid\\nof weaknesses and excesses (such as too much debt) and produce a new\\nbeginning in the form of a return to fundamentals on a sounder footing (albeit\\npainfully). After the con\\x00ict is resolved, it is clear who has what power, and\\nbecause most people desperately want peace, there is a resolution that produces\\nnew monetary, economic, and political systems—together, a new world order—\\nand fosters the next peaceful/creative period. Within this Big Cycle are other\\ncycles. For example, there are long-term debt cycles that last about 100 years and\\nshort-term debt cycles that last about eight years. This short-term cycle also has\\nwithin it longer, prosperous expansion periods that are interrupted by shorter\\nrecession periods, and within these cycles are shorter cycles, and so on.\\nBefore I get your head spinning with all this cycle stu\\x00, the main\\nthing I want to convey is that when the cycles align, the tectonic plates of\\nhistory shift, and the lives of all people change in big ways. These shifts\\nwill sometimes be terrible and sometimes terri\\x00c. They certainly will happen in\\nthe future, and most people will fail to anticipate them. In other words, \\n the\\nswinging of conditions from one extreme to another in a cycle is the norm, not the\\nexception.  It was a very rare country in a very rare century that didn’t have at least\\none boom/harmonious/prosperous period and one depression/civil\\nwar/revolution period, so we should expect both. Yet, most people throughout\\nhistory have thought (and still think today) that the future will look like a\\nslightly modi\\x00ed version of the recent past. That is because \\n the really big boomperiods and the really big bust perio ds, like many things, come along about once in a\\nlifetime and so they are surprising unless one has studied the patterns of history over many\\ngener ations.  Because the swings between great and terrible times tend to be far\\napart \\n the futur e we encounter is lik ely to be v ery diff erent fr om what most people expect.\\nFor example, my dad and most of his peers who went through the Great\\nDepression and World War II never imagined the post-war economic boom\\nbecause it was more di\\x00erent from than similar to what they had experienced. I\\nunderstand why, given those experiences, they wouldn’t think of borrowing and\\nputting their hard-earned savings into the stock market, so it’s understandable\\nthat they missed out on pro\\x00ting from the boom. Similarly, I understand why,\\ndecades later, those who only experienced debt-\\x00nanced booms and never\\nexperienced depression and war would borrow a lot in order to speculate and\\nwould consider depression and war implausible. The same is true with money:\\nmoney used to be “hard” (i.e., linked to gold) after World War II until\\ngovernments made money “soft” (i.e., \\x00at) to accommodate borrowing and\\nprevent entities from going broke in the 1970s. As a result, most people at the\\nmoment of my writing this book believe that they should borrow more, even\\nthough borrowing and debt-\\x00nanced booms have historically led to depressions\\nand internal and external con\\x00icts.\\nUnderstanding history in this way also raises questions whose answers\\nprovide us with valuable clues on what the future will be like. For example,\\nthroughout my life, the dollar has been the world’s reserve currency, monetary\\npolicy has been an e\\x00ective tool for stimulating economies, and democracy and\\ncapitalism have been widely regarded as the superior political and economic\\nsystems. Anyone who studies history can see that \\n no system of government, no\\neconomic system, no currency , and no empir e lasts forever, yet almost everyone is surprised\\nand ruined when they fail. Naturally I asked myself how would I and the people I\\ncare about know when we are entering one of these depression/revolution/war\\nperiods and how would we know how to navigate them well. Because my\\nprofessional responsibility is to preserve wealth regardless of the environment, I\\nneeded to develop an understanding and strategy that would have worked\\nthroughout history, including through these sorts of devastating times.The purpose of this book is to pass along what I learned that has helped me\\nand that I believe might help you. I present it for your consideration.\\nHOW I LEARNED T O AN TICIP ATE THE FUTURE B Y STUD YING THE\\nPAST\\nWhile it might seem odd that an investment manager who is required to make\\ninvestment decisions on short time frames would pay so much attention to long-\\nterm history, through my experiences I have learned that I need this perspective.\\nMy approach isn’t an academic one created for scholarly purposes; it is a very\\npractical one that I follow in order to do my job well. The game I play requires\\nme to understand what is likely to happen to economies better than the\\ncompetition does, so I have spent roughly 50 years closely observing most major\\neconomies and their markets—as well as their political conditions, since those\\na\\x00ect both—trying to understand what is happening well enough to bet on it.\\nFrom my years of wrestling with the markets and trying to come up with\\nprinciples for doing it well, I’ve learned that \\n one’s abili ty to anticipate and deal well\\nwith the futur e depends on one’s understanding of the cause/eff ect relationships that mak e\\nthings change, and one’s ability to understand these cause/eff ect relationships comes from\\nstudying how the y have changed in the past .\\nI arrived at this approach after the painful learning that the biggest mistakes\\nin my career came from missing big market moves that hadn’t happened in my\\nlifetime but had happened many times before. The \\x00rst of these big surprises for\\nme came in 1971 when I was 22 years old and clerking on the \\x00oor of the New\\nYork Stock Exchange as a summer job. I loved it because it was a fast-pasted game\\nof making and losing money played on a trading \\x00oor with people who liked to\\nhave a blast with each other—so much so that traders used to have water pistol\\n\\x00ghts right on the trading \\x00oor. I was engrossed in this game of watching the big\\ndevelopments in the world and betting on how they would drive the markets.\\nSometimes it could be dramatic.\\nOn a Sunday night—August 15, 1971—P resident Richard Nixon\\nannounced that the US would renege on its promise to allow paper dollars to be\\nturned in for gold. As I listened to Nixon speak, I realized that the USgovernment had defaulted on a promise and that money as we knew it had\\nceased to exist. That couldn’t be good, I thought. So on Monday morning I\\nwalked onto the \\x00oor of the exchange expecting pandemonium as stocks took a\\ndive. There was pandemonium all right, but not the sort I expected. Instead of\\nfalling, the stock market jumped about 4 percent as the dollar plummeted. I was\\nshocked. That’s because I hadn’t experienced a currency devaluation before. In\\nthe days that followed, I dug into history and saw that there were many cases of\\ncurrency devaluations that had had similar e\\x00ects on stock markets. By studying\\nfurther, I \\x00gured out why, and I learned something valuable that would help me\\nmany times in my future. It took a few more of those painful surprises to beat\\nthe realization into my head that I needed to understand all the big economic\\nand market moves that had happened in the last 100-plus years and in all major\\ncountries.\\nIn other words, if some big and important event had happened in the past\\n(like the Great Depression), I couldn’t say for sure that it wouldn’t happen to\\nme, so I had to \\x00gure out how it worked and be prepared to deal with it.\\nThrough my research I saw that there were many cases of the same types of\\nthings happening (e.g., depressions) and that by studying them just like a doctor\\nstudies many cases of a particular type of disease, I could gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of how they work. I studied these qualitatively and quantitatively\\nthrough my experiences, by speaking with preeminent experts, reading great\\nbooks, and digging into statistics and archives with my great research team.\\nFrom that learning came a visualization of an archetypical sequence of how\\nrises and declines in wealth and power typically happen. The archetype helps me\\nsee the cause/e\\x00ect relationships that drive how these cases typically progress.\\nWith that archetypical template speci\\x00ed, I can study deviations from it to try to\\nexplain them. Then I put these mental models into algorithms both to monitor\\nconditions relative to my archetypes and to help me make decisions based on\\nthem. This process helps me re\\x00ne my understanding of the cause/e\\x00ect\\nrelationships to the point where I can create decision-making rules—i.e.,\\nprinciples for dealing with my realities—in the form of “if/then” statements—\\ni.e., if X happens, then make Y bet. Then I watch actual events transpire relative\\nto that template and what we are expecting. I do these things in a very systematicway with my partners at Bridgewater Associates. If events are on track, we\\ncontinue to bet on what typically comes next; if events start to deviate from our\\ntemplate, we try to understand why and course correct. This process has helped\\nme both understand the big cause/e\\x00ect sequences that typically drive their\\nprogressions and gain a lot of humility. I do this continuously and will continue\\nto do it until I die, so what you are reading is a work in progress.2\\nTHIS APPRO ACH AFFEC TS HOW I SEE EVER YTHING\\nSeeing events in this way helped shift my perspective from being caught in the\\nblizzard of things coming at me to stepping above them to see their patterns\\nthrough time.3 The more related things I could understand in this way, the more\\nI could see how they in\\x00uence each other—e.g., how the economic cycle works\\nwith the political one—and how they interact over longer periods of time.\\nI believe that the reason people typically miss the big moments of\\nevolution coming at them in life is because they experience only tiny\\npieces of what’s happening. We are like ants preoccupied with our jobs of\\ncarrying crumbs in our very brief lifetimes instead of having a broader\\nperspective of the big-picture patterns and cycles, the important\\ninterrelated things driving them, where we are within the cycles, and\\nwhat’s likely to transpire. From gaining this perspective, I’ve come to believe\\nthat throughout history there are only a limited number of personality types4\\ngoing down a limited number of paths, which lead them to encounter a limited\\nnumber of situations to produce a limited number of stories that repeat over\\ntime. The only things that change are the clothes the characters are wearing, the\\nlanguages they are speaking, and the technologies they’re using.\\nTHIS STUD Y AND HOW I CAME T O DO I T\\nOne study led to another, which led me to do this study. More speci\\x00cally:Studying money and credit cycles throughout history made me\\naware of the long-term debt and capital markets cycle (which\\ntypically lasts about 50 to 100 years), which has led me to view what\\nis happening now in a very di\\x00erent way than if I hadn’t gained that\\nperspective. For example, interest rates hit 0 percent and central banks\\nprinted money and bought \\x00nancial assets in response to the 2008 \\x00nancial\\ncrisis. I had studied that happening in the 1930s, which helped me see how\\nand why central bank actions of creating a lot of money and credit/debt 90\\nyears ago pushed \\x00nancial asset prices up, which widened the wealth gap\\nand led to an era of populism and con\\x00ict. We are now seeing the same\\nforces at play in the post-2008 period.\\nIn 2014, I wanted to forecast economic growth rates in a number of\\ncountries because they were relevant to our investment decisions. I used the\\nsame approach of studying many cases to \\x00nd the drivers of growth and\\ncome up with timeless and universal indicators for anticipating countries’\\ngrowth rates over 10-year periods. Through this process, I developed a\\ndeeper understanding of why some countries did well and others did\\npoorly. I combined these indicators into gauges and equations that we used\\n(and continue to use) to produce 10-year growth estimates across the 20\\nlargest economies. Besides being helpful to us, I saw that this study could\\nhelp economic policy makers because, by seeing these timeless and universal\\ncause/e\\x00ect relationships, they could know that if they changed X, it would\\nhave Y e\\x00ect in the future. I also saw how these 10-year leading economic\\nindicators (such as the quality of education and the level of indebtedness)\\nwere worsening for the US relative to big emerging countries such as China\\nand India. This study is called “Productivity and Structural Reform: Why\\nCountries Succeed and Fail, and What Should Be Done So Failing\\nCountries Succeed.” (This study, and every other study mentioned here, is\\navailable for free at economicprinciples.org.)\\nSoon after the Trump election in 2016 and with increases in populism in\\ndeveloped countries becoming more apparent, I began a study called\\n“Populism: The Phenomenon.” That highlighted for me how gaps in\\nwealth and values led to deep social and political con\\x00icts in the 1930s thatare similar to those that exist now. It also showed me how and why\\npopulists of the left and populists of the right are more nationalistic,\\nmilitaristic, protectionist, and confrontational—and what such approaches\\nled to. I saw how powerful the con\\x00ict between the economic/political left\\nand right could become and the signi\\x00cant impact this con\\x00ict has on\\neconomies, markets, wealth, and power, which gave me a better\\nunderstanding of events that were and still are transpiring.\\nFrom doing these studies, and from observing numerous things that were\\nhappening around me, I saw that America was experiencing very large gaps\\nin people’s economic conditions, which were obscured by looking only at\\neconomic averages. So I divided the economy into quintiles, looking at the\\ntop 20 percent of income earners, the next 20 percent, and so on down to\\nthe bottom 20 percent, and examined the conditions of these populations\\nindividually. This resulted in two studies. In “Our Biggest Economic,\\nSocial, and Political Issue: The Two Economies—T he Top 40% and the\\nBottom 60%,” I saw the dramatic di\\x00erences in conditions between the\\n“haves” and the “have-nots,” which helped me understand the greater\\npolarity and populism I saw emerging. Those \\x00ndings, as well as the close\\ncontact my wife and I were having through her philanthropic work with\\nthe reality of wealth and opportunity gaps in Connecticut communities\\nand their schools, led to the research that became my study called “Why\\nand How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed.”\\nAt the same time, through my many years of international dealings in and\\nresearch on other countries, I saw huge global economic and geopolitical\\nshifts taking place, especially in China. I have been going to China for\\n37 years and am lucky enough to have become well-acquainted with\\nthe thinking of top economic policy makers and a broad range of\\nothers. Having this direct contact has helped me see up close the\\nreasoning behind their actions, which have produced remarkable\\nadvances. It is a fact that these people have led China to become an\\ne\\x00ective competitor with the US in production, trade, technology,\\ngeopolitics, and world capital markets, so how they’ve done this must be\\nexamined and understood without bias.My most recent study, on which this book is based, came about because of\\nmy need to understand three big forces that hadn’t happened before in\\nmy lifetime and the questions they prompt:\\n1. The Long-Term Debt and Capital Markets Cycle: At no point in our\\nlifetimes have interest rates been so low or negative on so much debt\\nas they are as of this writing. The value of money and debt assets is\\nbeing called into question by the supply-and-demand picture for\\nthem. In 2021, more than $16 trillion of debt was at negative\\ninterest rates and an unusually large amount of additional new debt\\nwill soon need to be sold to \\x00nance de\\x00cits. This is happening at the\\nsame time as huge pension and healthcare obligations loom large on the\\nhorizon. These circumstances raised some interesting questions for me.\\nNaturally I wondered why anyone would want to hold debt yielding a\\nnegative interest rate and how much lower interest rates could be pushed. I\\nalso wondered what will happen to economies and markets when they\\ncan’t be pushed lower and how central banks could be stimulative when\\nthe next downturn inevitably comes. Would central banks print a lot more\\ncurrency, causing its value to go down? What would happen if the currency\\nthat the debt is denominated in goes down while interest rates are so low?\\nThese questions in turn led me to ask what central banks would do if\\ninvestors \\x00ee debt denominated in the world’s major reserve currencies (i.e.,\\nthe dollar, the euro, and the yen), which would be expected if the money\\nthat they are being paid back in is both depreciating in value and paying\\ninterest rates that are so low.\\nA reserve currency is a currency that is accepted around the\\nworld for transactions and savings. The country that gets to print\\nthe world’s primary currency (now the US, but as we’ll see this has\\nchanged through history) is in a very powerful position, and debt\\nthat is denominated in the world’s reserve currency (i.e., US dollar-\\ndenominated debt now) is the most fundamental building block for\\nthe world’s capital markets and the world’s economies. It is also the\\ncase that all reserve currencies in the past have ceased to be reservecurrencies, often coming to traumatic ends for the countries that enjoyed\\nthis special power. So I also began to wonder whether, when, and why the\\ndollar will decline as the world’s leading reserve currency, what might\\nreplace it, and how that would change the world as we know it.\\n2. The Internal Order and Disorder Cycle: Wealth, values, and political\\ngaps are now larger than at any other point during my lifetime. By\\nstudying the 1930s and other prior eras when polarization was also high, I\\nlearned that which side wins out (i.e., left or right) will have very big\\nimpacts on economies and markets. So naturally I wondered what today’s\\ngaps will lead to. My examinations of history have taught me that \\n when\\nwealth and values gaps are large and there is an economic downturn, it is likely that\\nthere will be a lot of conﬂict about how to divide the pie. How will people and\\npolicy makers interact with each other when the next economic downturn\\narrives? I was especially concerned because of the limitations on central\\nbanks’ abilities to cut interest rates adequately to stimulate the economy. In\\naddition to these traditional tools being ine\\x00ective, printing money and\\nbuying \\x00nancial assets (now called “quantitative easing”) also widens the\\nwealth gap because buying \\x00nancial assets pushes up their prices, which\\nbene\\x00ts the wealthy who hold more \\x00nancial assets than the poor do. How\\nwould that play out in the future?\\n3. The External Order and Disorder Cycle: For the \\x00rst time in my life,\\nthe United States is encountering a true rival power. (The Soviet\\nUnion was only a military rival, never a signi\\x00cant economic one.)\\nChina has become a rival power to the United States in most ways\\nand is becoming strong in most ways at a faster rate. If trends continue,\\nChina will be stronger than the United States in the most important ways\\nthat an empire becomes dominant. Or at the very least, it will be a worthy\\ncompetitor. I have seen both countries up close for most of my life, and I\\nnow see how con\\x00ict is increasing fast, especially in the areas of trade,\\ntechnology, geopolitics, capital, and economic/political/social ideologies. I\\ncan’t help but wonder how these con\\x00icts, and the changes in the world\\norder that will result from them, will transpire in the years ahead and what\\ne\\x00ects that will have on us all.To gain the perspective I needed about these factors and what their\\ncon\\x00uence might mean, I looked at the rises and declines of all the major\\nempires and their currencies over the last 500 years, focusing most closely on the\\nthree biggest ones: the US Empire and the US dollar, which are most important\\nnow; the British Empire and the British pound, which were most important\\nbefore that; and the Dutch Empire and the Dutch guilder before that. I also\\nfocused less closely on the six other signi\\x00cant, though less \\x00nancially dominant,\\nempires of Germany, France, Russia, Japan, China, and India. Of those six, I\\ngave China the most attention and looked at its history back to the year 600\\nbecause 1) China was so important throughout history, 2) it’s so important now\\nand will likely be even more important in the future, and 3) it provides many\\ncases to look at of dynasties rising and declining, which helped me better\\nunderstand the patterns and the forces behind them. In these cases, a clearer\\npicture emerged of how other in\\x00uences, most importantly technology and acts\\nof nature, played signi\\x00cant roles.\\nFrom examining all these cases across empires and across time, I saw\\nthat the great empires typically lasted roughly 250 years, give or take 150\\nyears, with big economic, debt, and political cycles within them lasting\\nabout 50 to 100 years. By studying how these rises and declines worked\\nindividually, I could see how they worked on average in an archetypical way, and\\nthen I could examine how they worked di\\x00erently and why. Doing that taught\\nme a lot. My challenge now is trying to convey it to you.\\nYou can miss seeing these cycles if you watch events too close up or if you are\\nlooking at the averages rather than the individual cases. Almost everyone talks\\nabout what is happening now and nobody talks about these big cycles, even\\nthough they are the biggest drivers of what is happening now. When looking at\\nthe whole or at averages, you don’t see the individual cases of rises and declines,\\nwhich are far greater. For example, looking at a stock market average (e.g., the\\nS&P 500) and not looking at individual companies will lead you to miss the\\nimportant fact that almost all the individual cases that make up the average have\\nperiods of birth, growth, and death. If you experienced any one of these, you\\nwould have had a hell of a ride up followed by a hell of a ride down into ruin\\nunless you diversi\\x00ed and rebalanced your bets (e.g., the way it is done by S&P tocreate the index) or were able to discern the rising periods from the declining\\nperiods ahead of the crowd so as to be able to move well. By “move” I don’t just\\nmean move your position in markets—in the case of rising and falling empires, I\\nmean “move” in nearly everything, including where you live.\\nThis leads me to my next point: \\n to see the big pictur e, you can’t focus  on the\\ndetails.  While I will attempt to paint this big, sweeping picture accurately, I can’t\\npaint it in a precise way. Also, in order for you to see it and understand it, you\\ncan’t try to do so in a precise way. That is because we are looking at mega-macro\\ncycles and evolution over very long time frames. To see them, you will have to let\\ngo of the details. Of course, when the details are important, which they often\\nare, we will need to go from the very big imprecise picture to a more detailed\\none.\\nLooking at what happened in the past from this mega-macro perspective will\\nradically alter how you see things. For example, because the span of time covered\\nis so large, many of the most fundamental things that we take for granted and\\nmany of the terms we use to describe them do not exist over the full period of\\ntime. As a result, I will be imprecise in my wording so that I can convey the big\\npicture without getting tripped up on what might seem to be big things but, in\\nthe scope of what we are looking at, are relative details.\\nFor example, I wrestled with how much I should worry about the di\\x00erences\\nbetween countries, kingdoms, nations, states, tribes, empires, and dynasties.\\nNowadays we think mostly in terms of countries. However, countries as we\\nknow them didn’t come into existence until the 17th century, after the Thirty\\nYears’ War in Europe. In other words, before then there were no countries—\\ngenerally speaking, though not always, there were states and kingdoms instead.\\nIn some places, kingdoms still exist and can be confused with being countries,\\nand in some places they are both. Generally speaking, though not always,\\nkingdoms are small, countries are bigger, and empires are biggest (spreading\\nbeyond the kingdom or the country). The relationships between them are often\\nnot all that clear. The British Empire was mostly a kingdom that gradually\\nevolved into a country and then into an empire that extended way beyond\\nEngland’s borders, so that its leaders controlled broad areas and many non-\\nEnglish peoples.It’s also the case that each of these types of singularly controlled entities—\\nstates, countries, kingdoms, tribes, empires, etc.—controls its population in\\ndi\\x00erent ways, which further confuses things for those who seek precision. For\\nexample, in some cases empires are areas that are occupied by a dominant power,\\nwhile in other cases empires are areas in\\x00uenced by a dominant power through\\nthreats and rewards. The British Empire generally occupied the countries in its\\nempire while the American Empire has controlled more via rewards and threats\\n—though that is not entirely true, as at the time of this writing the US has\\nmilitary bases in at least 70 countries. Though it is clear that there is an\\nAmerican Empire, it is less clear exactly what is in it. Anyway, you get my point\\n—that trying to be precise can stand in the way of conveying the biggest, most\\nimportant things. So you are going to have to bear with my sweeping\\nimprecisions. You will also understand why I will henceforth imprecisely call\\nthese entities countries, even though not all of them were countries, technically\\nspeaking.\\nAlong these lines, some will argue that my comparing di\\x00erent countries\\nwith di\\x00erent systems in di\\x00erent times is impossible. While I can understand\\nthat perspective, I want to assure you that I will seek to explain whatever major\\ndi\\x00erences exist and that the timeless and universal similarities are much greater\\nthan the di\\x00erences. It would be tragic to let the di\\x00erences stand in the way of\\nseeing the similarities that provide us with the lessons of history we need.\\nREMEMBER TH AT WH AT I DON’T KNOW IS MUCH GREA TER TH AN\\nWHAT I KNOW\\nIn asking these questions, from the outset I felt like an ant trying to understand\\nthe universe. I had many more questions than answers, and I knew that I was\\ndelving into numerous areas that others have devoted their lives to studying.\\nOne of the bene\\x00ts of my circumstances is that I can speak with the world’s best\\nscholars who have studied history in depth as well as with the people who are in,\\nor have been in, the positions of making history. This allowed me to triangulate\\nwith the best of them. While each had in-depth perspectives on some pieces of\\nthe puzzle, none had the holistic understanding that I needed to adequatelyanswer all my questions. But by speaking with all of them and triangulating\\nwhat I learned with the research I did myself, the pieces started to fall into place.\\nThe people and tools at Bridgewater were also invaluable to this research.\\nBecause the world is a complicated place, playing the highly competitive game of\\nmaking sense of the past, processing what’s going on in the present, and using\\nthat information to bet on the future requires hundreds of people and great\\ncomputer power. For example, we actively consume about a hundred million\\ndata series that are run through our logic frameworks that systematically convert\\nthis information into trades in every market we can trade within every major\\ncountry in the world. I believe that our ability to see and process information\\nabout all major countries and all major markets is unparalleled. It was through\\nthis machine that I could see and attempt to understand how the world I’m\\nliving in works and I relied on it in doing this study.\\nStill, I can’t be sure that I’m right about anything.\\nWhile I have learned an enormous amount that I will put to good use, I know\\nthat what I know is still only a tiny portion of what I need to know to be\\ncon\\x00dent in my outlook for the future. I also know from experience that if I\\nwait to learn enough to be satis\\x00ed with what I know before acting or sharing,\\nI’d never be able to use or convey what I have learned. So please understand that\\nwhile this study will provide you with my very top-down, big-picture perspective\\non what I’ve learned and my very low-con\\x00dence outlook for the future, you\\nshould approach my conclusions as theories rather than facts. Keep in mind that\\neven with all of this, I have been wrong more times than I can remember, which\\nis why I value diversi\\x00cation of my bets above all else. So please realize that I’m\\njust doing the best I can to openly convey my thinking to you.\\nYou might be wondering why I wrote this book. In the past, I would have\\nbeen silent about what I’ve learned. However, I am now in the phase of my life\\nthat silently achieving more isn’t as important to me as passing along what I have\\nlearned in the hope that it can be of use to others. My main objectives are to\\nconvey to you my model for how the world works—to share with you a single\\ndigestible story of the last 500 years that shows how and why history “rhymes”\\nwith what is happening today—and to help you and others make better\\ndecisions so we all might have a better future.HOW THIS STUD Y IS ORGANIZED\\nAs with all my studies, I will attempt to convey what I learned in both\\nshorter, simpler ways (such as videos you can \\x00nd online), longer, more\\ncomprehensive ways (like this book), and even more comprehensive ways\\nfor those who want additional charts and historical examples (available\\nalong with everything else not printed in the book at\\neconomicprinciples.org). In order to make the most important concepts easy\\nto understand, this book is written in the vernacular, favoring clarity over\\nprecision. As a result, some of my wording will be by and large accurate but not\\nalways precisely so.\\nIn Part I, I will summarize all that I learned in a simpli\\x00ed archetype\\nof the rises and declines of empires, drawing from all my research of\\nspeci\\x00c cases. I will \\x00rst distill my \\x00ndings into an index of the total power of\\nempires, which provides an overview of the ebbs and \\x00ows of di\\x00erent powers\\nand which is constituted from eight indices of di\\x00erent types of power. I will\\nthen go into more detail on a list of 18 determinants that I believe to be the key\\nforces behind the rises and falls of empires and then I will cover in more detail\\nthe three big cycles mentioned previously. In Part II, I will show the\\nindividual cases in greater depth, walking through the story of the major\\nreserve currency empires over the last 500 years, including a chapter\\nfocused on the present day con\\x00icts between the US and China. Finally,\\nin the concluding Part III, I will discuss what all of this means for the\\nfuture.\\n1 To be clear, while I am describing these cycles of the past, I’m not one of those people who believes that\\nwhat happened in the past will necessarily continue into the future without understanding the cause/e\\x00ect\\nmechanics that drive changes. My objective above all else is to have you join with me in looking at the\\ncause/e\\x00ect relationships and then to use that understanding to explore what might be coming at us and\\nagree on principles to handle it in the best possible way.\\n2 For example, I have followed this approach for debt cycles because I’ve had to navigate many of them over\\nthe last 50 years and they are the most important force driving big shifts in economies and markets. If you\\nare interested in my template for understanding big debt crises and seeing all the cases that make it up, you\\ncan get Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises in free digital form at economicprinciples.org or in print\\nform for sale in bookstores or online. I’ve studied many big, important things (e.g., depressions,hyperin\\x00ation, wars, balance of payments crises, etc.) by following this approach, usually because I was\\ncompelled to understand unusual things that appeared to be germinating around me. It was that\\nperspective that allowed Bridgewater to navigate the 2008 \\x00nancial crisis well when others struggled.\\n3 I approach just about everything this way. For example, in building and running my business, I had to\\nunderstand the realities of how people think and learn principles for dealing with these realities well, which\\nI did using this same approach. If you are interested in what I learned about such non-economic and non-\\nmarket things, I conveyed it in my book Principles: Life and Work, which is free in an iOS/Android app\\ncalled Principles in Action or is for sale in the usual bookstores.\\n4 In my book Principles: Life and Work, I share my perspective on these di\\x00erent ways of thinking. I won’t\\ndescribe them here but will direct you there should you be interested.PART I\\nHOW THE WORLD WORKSCHAPTER 1\\nTHE BIG CYCLE IN A TINY NUTSHELL\\nAs explained in the introduction, the world order is now rapidly\\nshifting in important ways that have never happened in our lifetimes but\\nhave happened many times before. My objective is to show you those\\ncases and the mechanics that drove them and, with that perspective,\\nattempt to imagine the future.\\nWhat follows here is an ultra-distilled description of the dynamics that I saw\\nin studying the rises and declines of the last three reserve currency empires (the\\nDutch, the British, and the American) and the six other signi\\x00cant empires over\\nthe last 500 years (Germany, France, Russia, India, Japan, and China), as well as\\nall of the major Chinese dynasties back to the Tang Dynasty in around the year\\n600. The purpose of this chapter is simply to provide an archetype to use when\\nlooking at all the cycles, most importantly the one that we are now in.\\nIn studying these past cases, I saw clear patterns that occurred for logical\\nreasons that I brie\\x00y summarize here and cover more completely in subsequent\\nchapters. While the focus of this chapter and this book are on those forces that\\na\\x00ected the big cyclical swings in wealth and power, I also saw ripple-e\\x00ect\\npatterns in all dimensions of life, including culture and the arts, social mores,\\nand more, which I will touch on later. Between this simple archetype and the\\ncases shown in Part II, we will see how the individual cases \\x00t the archetype\\n(which is essentially just the average of those cases) and how well the archetype\\ndescribes the individual cases. Doing this, I hope, will help us better understand\\nwhat is happening now.I’m on a mission to \\x00gure out how the world works and to gain\\ntimeless and universal principles for dealing with it well. It’s both a\\npassion and a necessity for me. While the curiosities and concerns that I\\ndescribed earlier pulled me into doing this study, the process of conducting it\\ngave me a much greater understanding of the really big picture on how the world\\nworks than I expected to get, and I want to share it with you. It made much\\nclearer to me how peoples and countries succeed and fail over long swaths of\\ntime, it revealed giant cycles behind these ups and downs that I never knew\\nexisted, and, most importantly, it helped me put into perspective where we now\\nare.\\nFor example, through my research, I learned that the biggest thing\\na\\x00ecting most people in most countries through time is the struggle to\\nmake, take, and distribute wealth and power, though they also have\\nstruggled over other things too, most importantly ideology and religion.\\nThese struggles happened in timeless and universal ways and had huge\\nimplications for all aspects of people’s lives, unfolding in cycles like the tide\\ncoming in and out.\\nI also saw how, throughout time and in all countries, the people who\\nhave the wealth are the people who own the means of wealth production.\\nIn order to maintain or increase their wealth, they work with the people\\nwho have the political power, who are in a symbiotic relationship with\\nthem, to set and enforce the rules. I saw how this happened similarly\\nacross countries and across time. While the exact form of it has evolved and\\nwill continue to evolve, the most important dynamics have remained pretty\\nmuch the same. The classes of those who were wealthy and powerful evolved\\nover time (e.g., from monarchs and nobles who were landowners when\\nagricultural land was the most important source of wealth, to capitalists and\\nelected or autocratic political o\\x00cials now that capitalism produces capital assets\\nand that wealth and political power are generally not passed along in families)\\nbut they still cooperated and competed in basically the same ways.\\nI saw how, over time, this dynamic leads to a very small percentage of\\nthe population gaining and controlling exceptionally large percentages of\\nthe total wealth and power, then becoming overextended, and thenencountering bad times, which hurt those least wealthy and least\\npowerful the hardest, which then leads to con\\x00icts that produce\\nrevolutions and/or civil wars. When these con\\x00icts are over, a new world\\norder is created, and the cycle begins again.\\nIn this chapter, I will share more of this big-picture synthesis and\\nsome of the details that go along with it. While what you’re reading here are\\nmy own views, you should know that the ideas I express in this book have been\\nwell-triangulated with other experts. About two years ago, when I felt that I\\nneeded to answer the questions I described in the introduction, I decided to\\nimmerse myself in studying with my research team, digging through archives,\\nspeaking with the world’s best scholars and practitioners who each had in-depth\\nunderstandings of bits and pieces of the puzzle, reading relevant great books by\\ninsightful authors, and re\\x00ecting on the prior research I’ve done and the\\nexperiences that I’ve had from investing globally for nearly 50 years.\\nBecause I view this as an audacious, humbling, necessary, and fascinating\\nundertaking, I am worried about missing important things and being wrong, so\\nmy process is iterative. I do my research, write it up, show it to the world’s best\\nscholars and practitioners to stress test it, explore potential improvements, write\\nit up again, stress test it again, and so on, until I get to the point of diminishing\\nreturns. This study is the product of that exercise. While I can’t be sure that I\\nhave the formula for what makes the world’s greatest empires and their markets\\nrise and fall exactly right, I’m pretty con\\x00dent that I got it by and large right. I\\nalso know that what I learned is essential for my putting what is happening now\\ninto perspective and for imagining how to deal with important events that have\\nnever happened in my lifetime but have happened repeatedly throughout\\nhistory.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BIG CYCLE\\nFor reasons that are explained in this book, I believe that we are now\\nseeing an archetypical big shift in relative wealth and power and theworld order that will a\\x00ect everyone in all countries in profound ways.\\nThis big wealth and power shift is not obvious because most people don’t have\\nthe patterns of history in their minds to see this one as “another one of those.”\\nSo in this \\x00rst chapter, I will describe in a very brief way how I see the\\narchetypical mechanics behind rises and declines of empires and their markets\\nworking. I have identi\\x00ed 18 important determinants that have explained almost\\nall of the basic ebbs and \\x00ows through time that have caused ups and downs in\\nempires. We will look at them in a moment. Most of them transpire in classic\\ncycles that are mutually reinforcing in ways that tend to create a single very big\\ncycle of ups and downs. This archetypical Big Cycle governs the rising and\\ndeclining of empires and in\\x00uences everything about them, including their\\ncurrencies and markets (which I’m especially interested in). The most\\nimportant three cycles are the ones I mentioned in the introduction: the\\nlong-term debt and capital markets cycle, the internal order and disorder\\ncycle, and the external order and disorder cycle.\\nBecause these three cycles are typically the most important, we will be looking\\nat them in some depth in later chapters. Then we will apply them to history and\\nthe present day so that you can see how they play out in real examples.\\nThese cycles drive swings back and forth between opposites—swings between\\npeace and war, economic boom and bust, the political left and political right\\nbeing in power, the coalescing and disintegrating of empires, etc.—that typically\\noccur because people push things to extremes that surpass their equilibrium\\nlevels, which leads to swings that get overdone in the opposite direction.\\nEmbedded in the swings in one direction are the ingredients that lead to\\nthe swings in the opposite direction.\\nThese cycles have remained essentially the same through the ages for\\nessentially the same reason that the fundamentals of the human life cycle have\\nremained the same over the ages: because human nature doesn’t change much\\nover time. For example, fear, greed, jealousy, and other basic emotions have\\nremained constants and are big in\\x00uences that drive cycles.\\nWhile it is true that no two people’s life cycles are exactly the same and the\\ntypical life cycle has changed over the millennia, the archetype of the human life\\ncycle—of children being raised by parents until they are independent, at whichpoint they raise their own children and work, which they do until they get old,\\nretire, and die—remains essentially the same. Similarly the big\\nmoney/credit/capital markets cycle, which builds up too much debt and debt\\nassets (e.g., bonds) until the debts can’t be serviced with hard money, remains\\nessentially the same. As always, this leads to people trying to sell their debt assets\\nto make purchases and \\x00nding out they can’t because there are far too many\\ndebt assets relative to the amount of money and the value of stu\\x00 there is to buy.\\nOnce this happens, defaults prompt those who manufacture money to make\\nmore. That cycle has been essentially the same for thousands of years. So have\\nthe cycles of internal order and disorder and external order and disorder. We will\\nexplore how human nature and other dynamics drive these cycles in the coming\\nchapters.\\nEVOLUTION, CYCLES, AND THE BUMPS ALONG\\nTHE WAY\\nEvolution is the biggest and only permanent force in the universe, yet we\\nstruggle to notice it. While we see what exists and what happens, we don’t see\\nevolution and the evolutionary forces that make things exist and happen. Look\\naround you. Do you see evolutionary change? Of course not. Yet you know that\\nwhat you are looking at is changing—albeit slowly from your perspective—and\\nyou know that in time it won’t exist and other things will exist in its place. To see\\nthis change, we have to devise ways to measure things and watch the\\nmeasurements change. Then, once we can see the change, we can study why it\\nhappens. This is what we must do if we are going to successfully think about the\\nchanges ahead and how to deal with them.\\nEvolution is the upward movement toward improvement that occurs\\nbecause of adaptation and learning. Around it are cycles. To me, most\\neverything transpires as an ascending trajectory of improvement with\\ncycles around it, like an upward-pointing corkscrew:Evolution is a relatively smooth and steady improvement because the gaining\\nof knowledge is greater than the losing of knowledge. Cycles on the other hand\\nmove back and forth, producing excesses in one direction that lead to reversals\\nand excesses in the other, like the swinging of a pendulum. For example, over\\ntime our living standards rise because we learn more, which leads to higher\\nproductivity, but we have ups and downs in the economy because we have debt\\ncycles that drive actual economic activity up and down around that uptrend.\\nThese evolutionary and sometimes revolutionary changes around the trend are\\nnot always smooth and painless. Sometimes they are very abrupt and painful as\\nmistakes are made, learning occurs, and better adaptations result.\\nTogether evolution and cycles make the upward corkscrew-type movements\\nthat we see in everything—wealth, politics, biology, technology, sociology,\\nphilosophy, etc.\\nHuman productivity is the most important force in causing the\\nworld’s total wealth, power, and living standards to rise over time.\\nProductivity—i.e., the output per person, driven by learning, building, and\\ninventiveness—has steadily improved over time. However, it has risen at\\ndi\\x00erent rates for di\\x00erent people, though always for the same reasons—because\\nof the quality of people’s education, inventiveness, work ethic, and economic\\nsystems to turn ideas into output. These reasons are important for policy makers\\nto understand in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for their countries,\\nand for investors and companies to understand in order to determine where the\\nbest long-term investments are.\\nThis constantly increasing trend is the product of humanity’s capacity to\\nevolve, which is greater than any other species’ because our brain gives us aunique capacity to learn and think abstractly. As a result, our inventions of\\ntechnologies and ways of doing things have advanced uniquely. That evolution\\nhas led to the continuous evolutions that make up the changing world order.\\nTechnological advances in communications and transportation have brought\\neveryone in the world closer together, which has changed the nature of\\nrelationships of people and empires in profound ways. We see such evolutionary\\nimprovements apparent in just about everything—greater life expectancy, better\\nproducts, better ways of doing things, etc. Even our way of evolving has evolved\\nin the form of coming up with better ways to create and innovate. This has been\\ntrue for as long as human history has been written. As a result of this, charts of\\nmost everything show more upward slopes toward improvement than up and\\ndown movements.\\nThis is shown in the following charts: estimated output (i.e.,\\nestimated real GDP) per person and life expectancy over the last 500\\nyears. These are probably the two most widely agreed-upon measures of\\nwell-being, though they are imperfect. You can see the magnitudes of\\ntheir evolutionary uptrends relative to the magnitudes of the swings\\naround them.\\nThe fact that the trends are so pronounced relative to the swings\\naround the trends shows how much more forceful the power of human\\ninventiveness is relative to everything else. As shown from this top-down,\\nbig-picture perspective, output per person appears to be steadily\\nimproving, though very slowly in the early years and faster starting in\\nthe 19th century, when the slope up becomes much steeper, re\\x00ecting the\\nfaster productivity gains. This shift from slower productivity gains to faster\\nproductivity gains was primarily due to the improvements in broad learning and\\nthe conversion of that learning into productivity. That was brought about by a\\nnumber of factors going as far back as Gutenberg’s printing press in Europe in\\nthe mid-15th century (printing had already been in use in China for centuries),\\nwhich increased the knowledge and education available to many more people,\\ncontributing to the Renaissance, the Scienti\\x00c Revolution, the Enlightenment,\\nthe invention of capitalism, and the First Industrial Revolution in Britain. We\\nwill delve into these shortly.The broader-based improvements in productivity that came from the\\ninvention of capitalism, entrepreneurship, and the Industrial Revolution also\\nshifted wealth and power away from an agriculture-based economy in which\\nlandownership was the principal source of power, and monarchs, nobles, and\\nthe clergy worked together to maintain their grip on it. The shift moved toward\\nan industry-based economy in which inventive capitalists created and owned the\\nmeans of production of industrial goods and worked together with those in\\ngovernment to maintain the system that allowed them to have the wealth and\\npower. In other words, since the Industrial Revolution, which brought about\\nthat change, we have been operating in a system in which wealth and power have\\nprimarily come more from the combination of education, inventiveness, and\\ncapitalism, with those who run governments working with those who control\\nmost of the wealth and education.\\nHow this evolution with big cycles around it happens also continues to\\nevolve. For example, while ages ago agricultural land and agricultural production\\nwere worth the most and that evolved into machines and what they producedbeing worth the most, digital things that have no apparent physical existence\\n(data and information processing) are now evolving to become worth the most.5\\nThis is creating a \\x00ght over who obtains the data and how they use it to gain\\nwealth and power.\\nTHE CYCLES AROUND THE UPTREND\\nWhile signi\\x00cant, because these learnings and productivity\\nimprovements are evolutionary, they don’t cause big abrupt shifts in who\\nhas what wealth and power. The big abrupt shifts come from booms,\\nbusts, revolutions, and wars, which are primarily driven by cycles, and\\nthese cycles are driven by logical cause/e\\x00ect relationships. For example,\\nthe forces of increased productivity, entrepreneurship, and capitalism that\\nmarked the end of the 19th century also produced big wealth gaps and\\noverindebtedness that led to economic downturns that, in the \\x00rst half of the\\n20th century, led to anti-capitalism, communism, and big con\\x00icts over wealth\\nand power within and between countries. What you can see is evolution\\nmarching on with big cycles around it. \\n Throughout time, the formula for success has\\nbeen a system in which well-educated  people, oper ating civilly with each other , come up\\nwith inno vations, r eceiv e funding thr ough capital mark ets, and own the means b y which their\\ninno vations are turned into the production and allocation of resour ces, allowing them to be\\nrewar ded by proﬁt making.  However, over the long run capitalism has created\\nwealth and opportunity gaps and overindebtedness that have led to\\neconomic downturns and revolutions and wars that have caused changes\\nin the domestic and world orders.\\nAs you can see in the following charts, history shows us that almost all of\\nthese turbulent times were due to \\x00ghting over wealth and power (i.e., con\\x00icts\\nin the form of revolutions and wars, often driven by money and credit collapses\\nand big wealth gaps), and severe acts of nature (like droughts, \\x00oods, and\\nepidemics). It also shows that how bad these periods get depends almost\\nexclusively on how strong countries are and their ability to endure them. Countries with large savings, low debts, and a strong reser ve currency can withstand\\neconomic and cr edit collapses better than countries that don ’t ha ve much sa vings, ha ve a lot\\nof debt, and don’t have a strong reser ve currency . Likewise those that have strong and\\ncapable leadership and civil populations can be managed better than those that\\ndon’t have these, and those that are more inventive will adapt better than those\\nthat are less inventive. As you will see later, these factors are measurable timeless\\nand universal truths.\\nBecause these turbulent times are small in relation to the evolutionary\\nuptrend of humanity’s capacity to adapt and invent, they barely show up\\nin the previous charts of GDP and life expectancy, appearing only as\\nrelatively minor wiggles. Yet these wiggles seem very big to us because we\\nare so small and short-lived. Take the 1930–45 depression and war period, for\\nexample. The levels of the US stock market and global economic activity are\\nshown in the next chart. As you can see, the economy fell by about 10 percent,\\nand the stock market fell by about 85 percent and then began to recover.\\nThis is part of the classic money and credit cycle that has happened for as\\nlong as there has been recorded history and that I will explain more completely\\nin Chapter 3. Brie\\x00y, a credit collapse happens because there is too much debt.\\nTypically, the central government has to spend a lot of money it doesn’t have and\\nmake it easier for debtors to pay their debts and the central bank always has to\\nprint money and liberally provide credit—like they did in response to the\\neconomic plunge driven by the COVID pandemic and a lot of debt. The 1930s\\ndebt bust was the natural extension of the Roaring ’20s boom that became a\\ndebt-\\x00nanced bubble that popped in 1929. That produced a depression that led\\nto big central government spending and borrowing \\x00nanced by big money and\\ncredit creation by the central bank.\\nBack then, the popping of the bubble and the resulting economic bust were\\nthe biggest in\\x00uences on the 1930–45 period’s internal and external \\x00ghts for\\nwealth and power. Then, like now and like in most other cases, there were large\\nwealth gaps and con\\x00ict, which when heightened by debt/economic collapses,\\nled to revolutionary changes in social and economic programs and big wealthtransfers that were manifest in di\\x00erent systems in di\\x00erent countries. Clashes\\nand wars developed over which of these systems—e.g., capitalism or\\ncommunism, democracy or autocracy—w ere best. There are always\\narguments or \\x00ghts between those who want to make big redistributions\\nof wealth and those who don’t. In the 1930s, Mother Nature also gave the US\\na painful drought.\\nLooking over the whole of the cases I examined, past economic and market\\ndeclines lasted about three years, give or take a few years, depending on how long\\nit took to do the debt restructuring and/or debt monetization process. The\\nquicker the printing of money to \\x00ll the debt holes, the quicker the closing of\\nthe de\\x00ationary depression and the sooner the worrying about the value of\\nmoney began. In the 1930s US case, the stock market and the economy\\nbottomed the day that the newly elected president, Franklin D. Roosevelt,\\nannounced that he would default on the government’s promise to let people\\nturn in their money for gold, and that the government would create enough\\nmoney and credit so that people could get their money out of the banks and\\nothers could get money and credit to buy things and invest. That took three-\\nand-a-half years from the initial stock market crash in October 1929.6\\nStill there was \\x00ghting over wealth and power within and between countries.\\nThe emerging powers of Germany and Japan challenged the existing leading\\nworld powers of Great Britain, France, and eventually the US (which was\\ndragged into World War II). The war period raised the economic output of\\nthings that were used in the war, but it would be a misnomer to call the war years\\na “productive” period—even though when measured in output per person, it\\nwas—because there was so much destruction. At the end of the war, global GDP\\nper capita had fallen by about 12 percent, much of which was driven by declines\\nin the economies of countries that lost the war. The stress test that these years\\nrepresented wiped out a lot, made clear who the winners and losers were, and led\\nto a new beginning and a new world order in 1945. Classically that was followed\\nby a lengthy period of peace and prosperity that became overextended so that all\\ncountries are now, 75 years later, being stress tested again.\\nMost cycles in history happen for basically the same reasons. For\\nexample, the 1907–19 period began with the Panic of 1907 in the US, which,like the 1929–32 money and credit crisis following the Roaring ’20s, was the\\nresult of a boom period (the Gilded Age in the US, which was the same time as\\nthe Belle Époque in continental Europe and the Victorian Era in Great Britain)\\nbecoming a debt-\\x00nanced bubble that led to economic and market declines.\\nThese declines also happened when there were large wealth gaps that led to big\\nwealth redistributions and contributed to a world war. The wealth\\nredistributions, like those in the 1930–45 period, came about through large\\nincreases in taxes and government spending, big de\\x00cits, and big changes in\\nmonetary policies that monetized the de\\x00cits. Then the Spanish \\x00u intensi\\x00ed\\nthe stress test and the resulting restructuring process. This stress test and global\\neconomic and geopolitical restructuring led to a new world order in 1919, which\\nwas expressed in the Treaty of Versailles. That ushered in the 1920s debt-\\n\\x00nanced boom, which led to the 1930–45 period and the same things\\nhappening again.\\nThese periods of destruction/reconstruction devastated the weak,\\nmade clear who the powerful were, and established revolutionary new\\napproaches to doing things (i.e., new orders) that set the stage for periods\\nof prosperity that eventually became overextended as debt bubbles with\\nlarge wealth gaps and led to debt busts that produced new stress tests\\nand destruction/reconstruction periods (i.e., wars), which led to new\\norders and eventually the strong again gaining relative to the weak, and\\nso on.\\nWhat are these destruction/reconstruction periods like for the people who\\nexperience them? Since you likely haven’t been through one of these and the\\nstories about them are very scary, the prospect of being in one is worrisome to\\nmost people. It is true that these destruction/reconstruction periods have\\nproduced tremendous human su\\x00ering both \\x00nancially and, more importantly,\\nin lost or damaged human lives. While the consequences are worse for some\\npeople, virtually no one escapes the damage. Still, without minimizing them,\\nhistory has shown us that typically the majority of people stay employed in\\ndepressions, are unharmed in shooting wars, and survive natural disasters.\\nSome people who struggled through them have even described these very\\ndi\\x00cult times as bringing about important, good things like drawing peoplecloser together, building strength of character, learning to appreciate the basics,\\netc. For example, Tom Brokaw called the people who went through the 1930–45\\nperiod “the Greatest Generation” because of the strength of character it gave\\nthem. My parents and aunts and uncles who went through the Great Depression\\nand World War II, as well as others of their era whom I’ve spoken to in other\\ncountries who went through their own versions of this destruction period, saw it\\nthat way too. Keep in mind that economic destruction periods and war periods\\ntypically don’t last very long—roughly two or three years. And the lengths and\\nseverities of natural disasters (like droughts, \\x00oods, and epidemics) vary, though\\nthey typically lessen in painfulness as adaptations are made. One rarely gets all\\nthree of these types of big crises—economic, revolution/war, and natural\\ndisaster—at the same time.\\nMy point is that while these revolution/war periods typically lead to a\\nlot of human su\\x00ering, we should never, especially in the worst of times,\\nlose sight of the fact that one can navigate them well—and that\\nhumanity’s power to adapt and quickly get to new and higher levels of\\nwell-being is much greater than all the bad stu\\x00 that can be thrown at\\nus. For that reason, I believe that it is smart to trust and invest in humanity’s\\nadaptability and inventiveness. So, while I am pretty sure that in the coming\\nyears both you and I and the world order will experience big challenges and\\nchanges, I believe that humanity will become smarter and stronger in very\\npractical ways that will lead us to overcome these challenging times and go on to\\nnew and higher levels of prosperity.\\nNow let’s look at the cycles of rises and declines in the wealth and power of\\nthe major countries over the last 500 years.\\nPAST BIG CYCLE SHIFTS IN WEALTH AND\\nPOWER\\nThe chart of rising productivity shown earlier was for the whole world (to the\\nbest of our ability to measure it). It doesn’t show the shifts in wealth and powerthat occurred between countries. To understand how those happen, let’s start\\nwith the big-picture basics. Throughout recorded history various forms of\\ngroups of people (e.g., tribes, kingdoms, countries, etc.) have gained wealth and\\npower by building it themselves, taking it from others, or \\x00nding it in the\\nground. When they gathered more wealth and power than any other group, they\\nbecame the world’s leading power, which allowed them to determine the world\\norder. When they lost that wealth and power, which they all did, the world order\\n—and all aspects of life—changed in profound ways.\\nThe next chart shows the relative wealth and power of the 11 leading\\nempires over the last 500 years.\\nEach one of these indices7 of wealth and power is a composite of eight\\ndi\\x00erent determinants that I will explain shortly. Though these indices aren’t\\nperfect because all data through time isn’t perfect, they do an excellent job of\\npainting the big picture. As you can see, nearly all of these empires saw periods\\nof ascendancy followed by periods of decline.\\nTake a moment to study the thicker lines on the chart, which represent the\\nfour most important empires: the Dutch, British, American, and Chinese. These\\nempires held the last three reserve currencies—th e US dollar now, the Britishpound before it, and the Dutch guilder before that. China is included because it\\nhas risen to be the second most powerful empire/country and because it was so\\nconsistently powerful in most years prior to around 1850. To very brie\\x00y\\nsummarize the story this chart shows:\\nChina was dominant for centuries (consistently out-competing\\nEurope economically and otherwise), though it entered a steep\\ndecline starting in the 1800s.\\nThe Netherlands, a relatively small country, became the world’s\\nreserve currency empire in the 1600s.\\nThe UK followed a very similar path, peaking in the 1800s.\\nFinally, the US rose to become the world’s superpower over the last\\n150 years, though particularly during and after World War II.\\nThe US is now in relative decline while China is rising again.\\nNow let’s look at the same chart that extends the data all the way back\\nto the year 600. I focused on the \\x00rst chart (which covers just the last 500\\nyears) rather than the second (which covers the last 1,400 years) because it\\nhighlights the empires I studied most intently and is simpler—th ough with 11\\ncountries, 12 major wars, and over 500 years, it can hardly be called simple. Still,\\nthe second is more extensive and worth glancing at. I left out the shading of the\\nwar periods to lessen the complexity. As shown, in the pre-1500 period,\\nChina was almost always the most powerful, though the Middle Eastern\\ncaliphates, the French, the Mongols, the Spanish, and the Ottomans were\\nalso in the picture.An important thing to remember: while the leading powers covered in\\nthis study were the richest and most powerful, they weren’t necessarily\\nthe best-o\\x00 countries for two reasons. First, while wealth and power are\\nwhat most people want and will \\x00ght over most, some people and their\\ncountries don’t think that these things are the most important and\\nwouldn’t think of \\x00ghting over them. Some believe that having peace and\\nsavoring life are more important than having a lot of wealth and power and\\nwouldn’t consider \\x00ghting hard enough to gain enough of the wealth and power\\nto make it into this study, though some of them enjoyed greater amounts of\\npeace than those who fought for wealth and power. (By the way, I think there is\\na lot to be said for putting peace and savoring life ahead of gaining wealth and\\npower—interestingly, there was little correlation between the wealth and power\\nof a nation and the happiness of its people, which is a subject for another time.)\\nSecond, this group of countries excludes what I will call the “boutique\\ncountries” (like Switzerland and Singapore) that score very high in wealth and\\nliving standards but aren’t large enough to become one of the biggest empires.EIGHT DETERMINANTS OF WEALTH AND\\nPOWER\\nThe single measure of wealth and power that I showed you for each\\ncountry in the prior charts is a roughly equal average of 18 measures of\\nstrength. While we will explore the full list of determinants later, let’s begin by\\nfocusing on the key eight shown in the next chart: 1) education, 2)\\ncompetitiveness, 3) innovation and technology, 4) economic output, 5)\\nshare of world trade, 6) military strength, 7) \\x00nancial center strength,\\nand 8) reserve currency status.\\nThis chart shows the average of each of these measures of strength\\nacross all the empires I studied, with most of the weight on the most\\nrecent three reserve countries (i.e., the US, the UK, and the\\nNetherlands).8\\nThe lines in the chart do a pretty good job of telling the story of why\\nand how the rises and declines took place. You can see how rising\\neducation leads to increased innovation and technology, which leads to\\nan increased share of world trade and military strength, strongereconomic output, the building of the world’s leading \\x00nancial center,\\nand, with a lag, the establishment of the currency as a reserve currency.\\nAnd you can see how for an extended period most of these factors stayed\\nstrong together and then declined in a similar order. The common\\nreserve currency, just like the world’s common language, tends to stick\\naround after an empire has begun its decline because the habit of usage\\nlasts longer than the strengths that made it so commonly used.\\nI call this cyclical, interrelated move up and down the Big Cycle. Using\\nthese determinants and some additional dynamics, I will next describe the Big\\nCycle in more detail. But before I start, it’s worth reiterating that all of these\\nmeasures of strength rose and declined over the arc of the empire. That’s because\\nthese strengths and weaknesses are mutually reinforcing—i.e., strengths\\nand weaknesses in education, competitiveness, economic output, share of world\\ntrade, etc., contribute to the others being strong or weak, for logical reasons.\\nTHE ARCHETYPICAL BIG CYCLE\\nBroadly speaking, we can look at these rises and declines as happening in three\\nphases:\\nThe Rise:\\nThe rise is the prosperous period of building that comes after a\\nnew order. It is when the country is fundamentally strong because\\nthere are a) relatively low levels of indebtedness, b) relatively small\\nwealth, values, and political gaps between people, c) people working\\ne\\x00ectively together to produce prosperity, d) good education andinfrastructure, e) strong and capable leadership, and f) a peaceful\\nworld order that is guided by one or more dominant world powers,\\nwhich leads to…\\nThe Top:\\nThis period is characterized by excesses in the form of a) high levels\\nof indebtedness, b) large wealth, values, and political gaps, c)\\ndeclining education and infrastructure, d) con\\x00icts between\\ndi\\x00erent classes of people within countries, and e) struggles\\nbetween countries as overextended empires are challenged by\\nemerging rivals, which leads to…\\nThe Decline:\\nThis is the painful period of \\x00ghting and restructuring that leads\\nto great con\\x00icts and great changes and the establishment of new\\ninternal and external orders. It sets the stage for the next new\\norder and a new period of prosperous building.\\nLet’s look at each of these in more detail.\\nTHE RISE\\nThe rise phase begins when there is…\\n… strong enough and capable enough leadership to gain power and\\ndesign an excellent system to increase the country’s wealth and\\npower. Looking at the historically great empires, this system typically\\ninvolves…\\n… strong education, which is not just teaching knowledge and skills; it\\nalso includes teaching…… strong character, civility, and work ethic development. These are\\ntypically taught in families, schools, and/or religious institutions. If done\\nwell, this provides a healthy respect for rules and laws and order within\\nsociety, leads to low corruption rates, and is e\\x00ective in encouraging people\\nto work together to improve productivity. The better the country does this,\\nthe more there will be a shift from producing basic products to…\\n… innovating and inventing new technologies. For example, the Dutch\\nwere superbly inventive—at their peak they came up with a quarter of all\\nmajor inventions in the world. One of these were ships that could travel\\naround the globe to collect great riches. They also invented capitalism as we\\nknow it. Innovation is generally enhanced by being…\\n… open to the best thinking in the world to be able to learn the best\\nways of doing things and by…\\n… the workers, the government, and the military all working well\\ntogether.\\nAs a result of all of these things, the country…\\n… becomes more productive and…\\n… more competitive in world markets, which shows up in its…\\n… share of world trade rising. You can see this happening today as the\\nUS and China are now roughly comparable in both their economic\\noutputs and their shares of world trade.\\nAs a country trades more globally, it must protect its trade routes and\\nforeign interests and it must be prepared to defend itself from attack so it\\ndevelops great military strength.\\nIf done well, this virtuous cycle leads to…\\n… strong income growth, which can be used to \\x00nance…\\n… investments in infrastructure, education, and research and\\ndevelopment.The country must develop systems to incentivize and empower those\\nwho have the ability to make or get wealth. In all of these past cases,\\nthe most successful empires used a capitalist approach to incentivize and\\ndevelop productive entrepreneurs. Even China, which is run by the\\nChinese Communist Party, uses a state-capitalism approach to incentivize\\nand enable people. To do that incentivizing and \\x00nancial enabling well, the\\ncountry…\\n… has to have developing capital markets—most importantly its lending,\\nbond, and stock markets. That allows people to convert their savings\\ninto investments to fund innovation and development and share in\\nthe successes of those who are making great things happen. The inventive\\nDutch created the \\x00rst publicly listed company (the Dutch East India\\nCompany) and the \\x00rst stock market to fund it. These were integral parts\\nof their machine that produced a lot of wealth and power.\\nAs a natural consequence, all of the greatest empires developed the world’s\\nleading \\x00nancial center for attracting and distributing the capital of their\\ntimes. Amsterdam was the world’s \\x00nancial center when the Dutch were\\npreeminent, London was when the British were on top, New York is now,\\nand China is quickly developing its own \\x00nancial center in Shanghai.\\nAs the country expands its international dealings to become the largest\\ntrading empire, its transactions can be paid in its currency, and people\\naround the world want to save in it, so it becomes the world’s leading\\nreserve currency, which enables the country to borrow more, and at lower\\nrates, than other countries because others want to lend in it.\\nThis series of cause/e\\x00ect relationships leading to mutually supportive \\x00nancial,\\npolitical, and military powers has gone together for as long as there has been\\nrecorded history. All of the empires that became the most powerful in the\\nworld followed this path to the top.\\nTHE TOPIn the top phase, the country sustains the successes that fueled its rise,\\nbut embedded in the rewards of the successes are the seeds of decline.\\nOver time, obligations pile up, breaking down the self-reinforcing\\ncircumstances that fueled the rise.\\nAs people in the country, which is now rich and powerful, earn\\nmore, that makes them more expensive and less competitive relative\\nto people in other countries who are willing to work for less.\\nAt the same time people from other countries naturally copy the\\nmethods and technologies of the leading power, which further\\nreduces the leading country’s competitiveness. For example, British\\nshipbuilders hired Dutch designers to design better ships that were built by\\nless expensive British workers, making them more competitive, which led\\nthe British to rise and the Dutch to decline.\\nAlso, as people in the leading country become richer, they tend to\\nnot work as hard. They enjoy more leisure, pursue the \\x00ner and less\\nproductive things in life, and at the extreme become decadent. Values\\nchange from generation to generation during the rise to the top—from\\nthose who had to \\x00ght to achieve wealth and power to those who inherited\\nit. The new generation is less battle-hardened, steeped in luxuries, and\\naccustomed to the easy life, which makes them more vulnerable to\\nchallenges.\\nAdditionally, as people get used to doing well, they increasingly bet\\non the good times continuing—and borrow money to do that—\\nwhich leads to \\x00nancial bubbles.\\nWithin capitalist systems, \\x00nancial gains come unevenly so the wealth\\ngap grows. Wealth gaps are self-reinforcing because rich people use their\\ngreater resources to expand their powers. They also in\\x00uence the\\npolitical system to their advantage and give greater privileges to\\ntheir children—like better education—causing the gaps in values,\\npolitics, and opportunity to develop between the rich “haves” and\\nthe poor “have-nots.” Those who are less well-o\\x00 feel the system is\\nunfair so resentments grow.As long as the living standards of most people are still rising, these\\ngaps and resentments don’t boil over into con\\x00ict.\\nDuring the top, the leading country’s \\x00nancial picture begins to change. Having\\na reserve currency gives it the “exorbitant privilege”9 of being able to borrow\\nmore money, which gets it deeper into debt. This boosts the leading empire’s\\nspending power over the short term and weakens it over the longer run.\\nInevitably, the country begins borrowing excessively, which\\ncontributes to the country building up large debts with foreign\\nlenders.\\nWhile this boosts spending power over the short term, it weakens the\\ncountry’s \\x00nancial health—and weakens the currency—over the\\nlonger term. In other words, when borrowing and spending are\\nstrong, the empire appears very strong, but its \\x00nances are in fact\\nbeing weakened because the borrowing sustains the country’s power\\nbeyond its fundamentals by \\x00nancing both domestic\\noverconsumption and international military con\\x00icts required to\\nmaintain the empire.\\nAlso the costs of maintaining and defending the empire become greater\\nthan the revenue it brings in, so having an empire becomes\\nunpro\\x00table. For example, the British Empire became massive,\\nbureaucratic, and lost its competitive advantages as rival powers—\\nparticularly Germany—soared, leading to an increasingly expensive arms\\nrace and world war.\\nThe richer countries get into debt by borrowing from poorer\\ncountries that save more—that is one of the earliest signs of a wealth and\\npower shift. This started in the United States in the 1980s when it had a per\\ncapita income 40 times that of China’s and started borrowing from the\\nChinese who wanted to save in dollars because the dollar was the world’s\\nreserve currency.If the empire begins to run out of new lenders, those holding their\\ncurrency begin to look to sell and get out rather than buy, save, lend,\\nand get in—and the strength of the empire begins to fall.\\nTHE DECLINE\\nThe decline phase typically comes from internal economic weakness together\\nwith internal \\x00ghting, or from costly external \\x00ghting, or both. Typically, the\\ncountry’s decline comes gradually and then suddenly.\\nInternally…\\nWhen debts become very large, and there is an economic downturn and\\nthe empire can no longer borrow the money necessary to repay its debts,\\nthis creates great domestic hardships and forces the country to choose\\nbetween defaulting on its debts and printing a lot of new money.\\nThe country nearly always chooses to print a lot of new money, at\\n\\x00rst gradually and eventually massively. This devalues the currency and\\nraises in\\x00ation.\\nTypically at those times when the government has problems funding itself\\n—at the same time as there are bad \\x00nancial and economic conditions, and\\nlarge wealth, values, and political gaps—there are great increases in\\ninternal con\\x00ict between the rich and poor and di\\x00erent ethnic,\\nreligious, and racial groups.\\nThis leads to political extremism that shows up as populism of the\\nleft or of the right. Those of the left seek to redistribute the wealth while\\nthose of the right seek to maintain the wealth in the hands of the rich. This\\nis the “anti-capitalist phase,” when capitalism, capitalists, and the\\nelites in general are blamed for the problems.\\nTypically during such times taxes on the rich rise, and when the rich\\nfear their wealth and well-being will be taken away, they move toplaces, assets, and currencies they feel safer in. These out\\x00ows\\nreduce the country’s tax revenue, which leads to a classic self-\\nreinforcing, hollowing-out process.\\nWhen the \\x00ight of wealth gets bad enough, the country outlaws it.\\nThose seeking to get out begin to panic.\\nThese turbulent conditions undermine productivity, which shrinks\\nthe economic pie and causes more con\\x00ict about how to divide the\\nshrinking resources. Populist leaders emerge from both sides and pledge\\nto take control and bring about order. That’s when democracy is most\\nchallenged because it fails to control the anarchy and because the\\nmove to a strong populist leader who will bring order to the chaos is\\nmost likely.\\nAs con\\x00ict within the country escalates, it leads to some form of\\nrevolution or civil war to redistribute wealth and force the big\\nchanges. This can be peaceful and maintain the existing internal order, but\\nit’s more often violent and changes the order. For example, the\\nRoosevelt revolution to redistribute wealth was relatively peaceful, while\\nthe revolutions that changed the domestic orders in Germany, Japan, Spain,\\nRussia, and China, which also happened in the 1930s for the same reasons,\\nwere much more violent.\\nThese civil wars and revolutions create what I call new internal orders. I’ll\\nexplore how internal orders change in a cyclical way in Chapter 5. But the\\nimportant thing to note for now is that internal orders can change without\\nleading to a change in the world order. It’s only when the forces that produce\\ninternal disorder and instability align with an external challenge that the\\nentire world order can change.\\nExternally…\\nWhen there is a rising great power that is capable of challenging the\\nexisting great power and existing world order, there is a rising riskof great international con\\x00ict, especially if there is internal con\\x00ict\\ngoing on within the existing great power. Typically the rising\\ninternational opponent will seek to exploit this domestic weakness.\\nThis is especially risky if the rising international power has built up\\na comparable military.\\nDefending oneself against foreign rivals requires great military\\nspending, which has to occur even as domestic economic conditions\\nare deteriorating and the leading great power country can least a\\x00ord it.\\nSince there is no viable system for peacefully adjudicating international\\ndisputes, these con\\x00icts are typically resolved through tests of power.\\nAs bolder challenges are made, the leading empire is faced with the\\ndi\\x00cult choice of \\x00ghting or retreating. Fighting and losing are the\\nworst, but retreating is bad too because it allows the opposition to progress\\nand it shows that one is weak to those other countries that are considering\\nwhat side to be on.\\nPoor economic conditions cause more \\x00ghting for wealth and power,\\nwhich inevitably leads to some kind of war.\\nWars are terribly costly. At the same time, they produce the\\nnecessary tectonic shifts that realign the world order to the new\\nreality of wealth and power.\\nWhen those holding the reserve currency and debt of the declining\\nempire lose faith and sell them, that marks the end of its Big Cycle.\\nWhen all of these forces line up—indebtedness, civil war/revolution at\\nhome, war abroad, and a loss of faith in the currency—a change in the\\nworld order is typically at hand.\\nYou can see these forces summarized in their typical progression in the\\nfollowing chart.I threw a lot at you in the last few pages. You might want to read them again\\nslowly so you can see if the sequence makes sense to you. Later, we will get into a\\nnumber of speci\\x00c cases in greater depth and you will see the patterns of these\\ncycles emerge, albeit not in a precise way. The fact that they occur and the\\nreasons for them occurring are less disputable than the exact timing of their\\noccurrences.\\nTo summarize, around the upward trend of productivity gains that\\nproduce rising wealth and better living standards, there are cycles that\\nproduce prosperous periods of building in which the country is\\nfundamentally strong because there are relatively low levels of\\nindebtedness, relatively small wealth, values, and political gaps, people\\nworking e\\x00ectively together to produce prosperity, good education and\\ninfrastructure, strong and capable leadership, and a peaceful world order\\nthat is guided by one or more dominant world powers. These are the\\nprosperous and enjoyable periods. When they are taken to excess, which\\nthey always are, the excesses lead to depressing periods of destruction and\\nrestructuring in which the country’s fundamental weaknesses of high\\nlevels of indebtedness, large wealth, values, and political gaps, di\\x00erent\\nfactions of people unable to work well together, poor education and\\ninfrastructure, and the struggle to maintain an overextended empire\\nunder the challenge of emerging rivals lead to a painful period of\\n\\x00ghting, destruction, and then a restructuring that establishes a new\\norder, setting the stage for a new period of building.Because these steps unfold in a logical sequence of timeless and\\nuniversal cause/e\\x00ect relationships, it is possible to create a health index\\nof where a country stands by looking at these measures. When the\\nmeasures are strong/good, the condition of the country is strong/good\\nand the period ahead is much more likely to be strong/good; when the\\nratings of these items are weak/bad, the condition of the country is\\nweak/bad and the period ahead is much more likely to be weak/bad.\\nIn the following table, to help paint the picture, I converted most of\\nour measures into colors, with dark green being a very favorable reading\\nand dark red being a very unfavorable reading. It is the average of these\\nreadings that de\\x00nes which stage of the cycle a country is in, in much the same\\nway as it is the average of the eight readings of power that I use as my measure of\\ntotal power. Like those power readings, while one could recon\\x00gure them to\\nproduce marginally di\\x00erent readings, they are broadly indicative in a by-and-\\nlarge way. Here, I am showing this to exemplify the typical process, not to look\\nat any speci\\x00c case. I will however show speci\\x00c quantitative readings for all the\\nmajor countries later in this book.10\\nSince all of these factors, both ascending and descending, tend to be mutually\\nreinforcing, it is not a coincidence that large wealth gaps, debt crises, revolutions,\\nwars, and changes in the world order have tended to come as a perfect storm.\\nThe Big Cycle of an empire’s rise and decline looks like the following chart. The\\nbad periods of destruction and restructuring via depression, revolution, and war,which largely tear down the old system and set the stage for the emergence of a\\nnew system, typically take about 10 to 20 years, though variations in the range\\ncan be much larger. They are depicted by the shaded areas. They are followed by\\nmore extended periods of peace and prosperity in which smart people work\\nharmoniously together and no country wants to \\x00ght the world power because\\nit’s too strong. These peaceful periods last for about 40 to 80 years, though\\nvariations in the range can be much larger.\\nFor example, when the Dutch Empire gave way to the British Empire and\\nwhen the British Empire gave way to the US Empire, most or all of the following\\nthings happened:\\nEnd of the Old, Beginning of the\\nNew (e.g., Dutch t o British)End of the Old, Beginning of the\\nNew (e.g., British t o US)\\nDebt restructuring and debt crisis\\nInternal revolution (peaceful or\\nviolent) that leads to large\\ntransfers of wealth from the\\n“haves” to the “have-nots”\\nExternal war\\nBig currency breakdown\\nNew domestic and world order\\nDebt restructuring and debt crisis\\nInternal revolution (peaceful or\\nviolent) that leads to large\\ntransfers of wealth from the\\n“haves” to the “have-nots”\\nExternal war\\nBig currency breakdown\\nNew domestic and world order\\nA PREVIEW OF WHERE WE ARE NOWAs previously explained, the last major period of destroying and restructuring\\nhappened in 1930–45, which led to the period of building and the new world\\norder that began in 1945 with the creation a new global monetary system (built\\nin 1944 in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire) and a US-dominated system of\\nworld governance (locating the United Nations in New York and the World\\nBank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC). The new\\nworld order was the natural consequence of the US being the richest country (it\\nthen had two-thirds of the world’s gold stock and gold was then money), the\\ndominant economic power (it then accounted for about half of world\\nproduction), and the strongest military (it then had a monopoly on nuclear\\nweapons and the strongest conventional forces).\\nAt the time of my writing, it is now 75 years later, and the major old\\nempires, which are also the major reserve currency empires, are classically\\napproaching the end of a long-term debt cycle when there are large debts\\nand typical monetary policies don’t work well. Politically fragmented\\ncentral governments have recently tried to \\x00ll in their \\x00nancial holes by\\ngiving out a lot of money that they are borrowing, while central banks\\nhave tried to help by printing a lot of money (i.e., monetizing\\ngovernment debt). All this is happening when there are big wealth and\\nvalues gaps and a rising world power that is competing with the leading\\nworld power in trade, technology development, capital markets, and\\ngeopolitics. And on top of all this, as of this writing we have a pandemic\\nto contend with.\\nSimultaneously, great human thinking, working with computer intelligence,\\nis creating great ways of addressing these challenges. If we can all deal with each\\nother well, we will certainly get past this di\\x00cult time and move on to a new\\nprosperous period that will be quite di\\x00erent. At the same time, I am equally\\ncon\\x00dent that there will be radical changes that will be traumatic for many\\npeople.\\nThat is how the world works in a nutshell. Now I will give a more expanded\\ndescription.5 At this time, humanity is evolving its ways of thinking and increasing productivity in more dramatic ways\\nthan ever before—even more dramatically than the discovery and usage of the scienti\\x00c method. We are\\ndoing this through the development of arti\\x00cial intelligence, which is an alternative way of thinking via an\\nalternative brain that can make discoveries and process them into instructions of what should be done.\\nHumanity is essentially creating an alternative species that has enormous capacity to see past patterns and\\nprocess many di\\x00erent ideas very quickly, has little or no common sense, has trouble understanding the\\nlogic behind relationships, and doesn’t have emotions. This species is simultaneously smart and stupid,\\nhelpful and dangerous. It o\\x00ers great potential and needs to be well-controlled and not blindly followed.\\n6 In 2008, it took two months from the crash to the printing of money; in 2020, it took just weeks.\\n7 These indices are made up of a number of di\\x00erent statistics, some of which are directly comparable and\\nsome of which are broadly analogous or broadly indicative. In some cases, a data series that stopped at a\\ncertain point had to be spliced with a series that continued back in time. Additionally, the lines shown on\\nthe chart are 30-year moving averages of these indices, shifted so that there is no lag. I chose to use the\\nsmoothed series because the volatility of the unsmoothed series was too great to allow one to see the big\\nmovements. Going forward, I will use these very smoothed versions when looking at the very long term and\\nmuch less smoothed or unsmoothed versions when looking at these developments up close because the\\nmost important developments are best captured this way.\\n8 We show where key indicators were relative to their history by averaging them across the cases. The chart is\\nshown such that a value of 1 represents the peak in that indicator relative to history and 0 represents the\\ntrough. The timeline is shown in years with 0 representing roughly when the country was at its peak (i.e.,\\nwhen the average across the gauges was at its peak). In the rest of this chapter, we walk through each of the\\nstages of the archetype in more detail.\\n9 “Exorbitant privilege” is a way of describing a reserve currency that was coined by French Finance\\nMinister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing as a description of the position of the US.\\n10 Acts of nature, external order, and geology are not included in cycle analysis. Readings use proxies for\\ndeterminants with limited history.CHAPTER 2\\nTHE DETERMINANTS\\nIn the last chapter I described the Big Cycle in a tiny nutshell. In this and\\nthe other chapters that follow in Part I, I will \\x00esh out how I see the\\nperpetual-motion machine working. In this chapter, I will review the\\nmost important determinants and summarize how I put them into my\\n“model.”\\nAs the saying goes, and most people agree, “history rhymes.” It “rhymes”\\nbecause its most important events repeat, though never in exactly the same way.\\nThat is because, while the cause/e\\x00ect relationships behind those events are\\ntimeless and universal, all things evolve and in\\x00uence each other in di\\x00erent\\nways. By studying many analogous events in di\\x00erent times and places, their\\nunderlying causes and e\\x00ects become clearer. I have learned that history’s\\ncontinuously evolving story transpires like a perpetual-motion machine that is\\ndriven by cause/e\\x00ect relationships that both evolve and repeat over time.\\nTo deal with the realities that are coming at me, my process is to…\\nInteract with this machine and try to understand how it works\\nWrite down my observations of its workings, along with the\\nprinciples I have learned for dealing with them\\nBacktest those principles through time\\nConvert the principles into equations and program them into a\\ncomputer that helps me with my decision makingLearn from my experiences and my re\\x00ections on my experiences, so\\nI can re\\x00ne my principles\\nDo that over and over again\\nImagine a chess player who records their criteria for making di\\x00erent moves\\nin di\\x00erent situations, which they then encode into a computer that plays\\nalongside them like a partner. Each player brings what they are best at to the\\ngame. The human player is more inventive, more lateral in thinking, and better\\nable to reason, while the computer can calculate more data faster, is better able\\nto identify patterns, and is much less emotional. This never-ending process of\\nlearning, building, using, and re\\x00ning in partnership with computers describes\\nwhat I do, except my game is global macro investing, not chess.\\nIn this chapter, I will share my description of the workings of the\\nperpetual-motion machine that drives the rises and declines of empires\\nand their reserve currencies as I have come to understand it thus far,\\ngiving you a glimpse into how I play my game. While I’m sure my mental\\nmodel is wrong and incomplete in any number of ways, it is the best one that I\\nhave now and it has proven invaluable to me. I am passing it along for you to\\nprobe and explore, take or leave, and build on as you like. My hope is that I will\\nprompt you and others to think about the timeless and universal cause/e\\x00ect\\nrelationships that drive the realities that are coming at us, and the best principles\\nfor dealing with them. By stress testing and improving this model through full-\\nthroated debate, we will get to the point where we have a largely agreed-upon\\ntemplate of the processes and their causes. By using that template, we can then\\nstrive to agree on which stage each country is in and what the best practices are\\nfor interacting with it, whether we are individuals taking care of our own\\ninterests or we are leaders taking care of our country’s.\\nIn the last chapter, I conveyed a very simpli\\x00ed description of the\\ndeterminants of the evolution and cyclical rises and declines of empires—mo st\\nimportantly, what I believe to be the primary drivers of the Big Cycles. In this\\nchapter, I will explain the model in much greater detail. It is based on what I saw\\nhappen repeatedly through time in the 11 leading empires of the last 500 years,\\nthe 20 most important countries of the last 100 years, and the major dynasties ofChina over the last 1,400 years. To be clear, I do not consider myself to be an\\nexpert historian in these cases, and these cases represent only a small percentage\\nof all cases. I only glanced at some of the most important empires in early\\nhistory, such as the Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Byzantine, Mongol, Han, Sui,\\nArab, and Persian empires, and I completely neglected many of the other\\nempires that have risen and declined throughout the world in Africa, South\\nAsia, the Paci\\x00c Islands, and precolonial North and South America. In other\\nwords, what I didn’t examine was much greater than what I did examine. Still, I\\nbelieve I have seen enough to develop a good mental model that applies to most\\ncountries, which has been very helpful to my e\\x00orts to understand what is going\\non today and which helps me to form a valuable, though hazy, picture of the\\nfuture.\\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF MY MENTAL MODEL\\nOF THE PERPETUAL-MOTION MACHINE\\nJust as we can see the arc of the human life cycle from birth to death and how\\none generation impacts the next, we can do the same with countries and\\nempires. We can see how values, assets, liabilities, and experiences are handed\\ndown and how their evolutionary e\\x00ects ripple out across the generations. We\\ncan tell when an empire is approaching its peak and when it is in decline.\\n All people s throughout history have had systems or orders for governing how they deal\\nwith each other . I call the systems within countries “internal orders, ” those between\\ncountries “external orders, ” and those that apply to the whole world “world orders. ” These\\norders affect each other and are alwa ys changing.  Such orders have always existed at\\nevery level—within families, companies, cities, states, and countries, as well as\\ninternationally. They determine who has what powers and how decisions are\\nmade, including how wealth and political control are divided. What they are and\\nhow they run is a function of human nature, culture, and circumstances. The\\nUS now has a certain set of existing political conditions within its democraticsystem, but both the conditions and the system are ever-changing because of the\\npressure of timeless and universal forces.\\nThe way I see it, at any moment in time there are both 1) the existing\\nset of conditions that include the existing domestic and world orders and\\n2) timeless and universal forces that cause changes in these conditions.\\nMost people tend to pay too much attention to what exists relative to the\\ntimeless and universal forces that produce the changes. I do the opposite in my\\nattempt to anticipate change. Everything that has happened and everything\\nthat will happen has had and will have determinants that make it\\nhappen. If we can understand those determinants, we can understand\\nhow the machine works and anticipate what will likely be coming at us\\nnext.\\nSince everything that happened and will happen was and is due to the\\ninteractions of the parts of this perpetual-motion machine, one can say that\\neverything is predestined. I believe that, if we had a perfect model that took every\\ncause/e\\x00ect relationship into consideration, we could perfectly forecast the\\nfuture—that the only thing that stands in the way is our inability to model all\\nthose cause/e\\x00ect dynamics. While that might or might not be right, it tells you\\nwhere I’m coming from and what I’m striving for.\\nMost people don’t see things that way. Most people believe the future is\\nunknowable and that destiny doesn’t exist. To be clear, while having a perfect\\nmodel that gives a nearly perfect picture of that predestined future would be\\ngreat, I don’t expect my model to come close to that. My goal is simply to have a\\ncrude yet evolving model that gives me a leg up relative to the competition and\\nrelative to the position I would be in if I didn’t have the model.\\nTo build this model, I looked at history quantitatively as well as qualitatively\\nbecause 1) by measuring conditions and their changes, I can more objectively\\ndetermine the cause/e\\x00ect relationships behind them, develop a likely range of\\nexpectations, and systemize my decision making accordingly but 2) I can’t\\nmeasure everything quantitatively.\\nMy process is to look at many cases to observe how their determinants\\ncreated the e\\x00ects that de\\x00ne them. To give a simple example, a lot of\\ndebt (a determinant) together with tight money (another determinant)will typically produce a debt crisis (the e\\x00ect). Similarly, when the three big\\ncycles that I described in the last chapter come together in a bad way (heavy\\nindebtedness with the central bank printing a lot of money; internal con\\x00ict\\nstemming from gaps in wealth, values, and politics; and the rise of one or more\\ncompeting powers), that typically leads to the decline of an incumbent empire.\\nIn my mental model, the relationship between the determinants and\\ntheir e\\x00ects in the various cases looks like this:\\nHow the Machine W orks = (f )…\\n\\xa0 Case\\n1Case\\n2Case\\n3Case\\n4Case\\n5Case\\n6Case\\n7Case\\n8Case\\n9Case\\n10,\\nEtc\\nDeterminant\\n1Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n2Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n3Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n4Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n5Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n6Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n7Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n8Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n9Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nDeterminant\\n10Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect Effect\\nEtc \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Determinants lead to e\\x00ects that become subsequent determinants that\\nproduce subsequent e\\x00ects that become linked together in many cases. So\\nwe can look at each case and see what happened (the e\\x00ect) and what\\nmade it happen (its determinants). Or we can look at the determinants to\\nsee the e\\x00ects they had to make up the various cases. The determinants\\nare both what exists and the energy that produces changes; like energy\\nand matter, at the end of the day they’re the same. They create new\\ncircumstances and new determinants that create the next changes.\\nThat is how I quite literally try to model the perpetual-motion machine.\\nTHE 3, THE 5, THE 8, AND THE 18\\nDETERMINANTS\\nIn the last chapter, I introduced you to what I believe are the three big cycles and\\nthe eight most important determinants of the rises and declines of empires and\\ntheir currencies. Because thinking about all of these determinants and\\ntheir interactions is complex, I suggest that you keep the three big cycles\\nin mind as the most important things to watch: 1) the cycle of good and\\nbad \\x00nances (e.g., the capital markets cycle), 2) the cycle of internal order\\nand disorder (due to degrees of cooperation and \\x00ghting over wealth and\\npower largely caused by wealth and values gaps), and 3) the cycle of\\nexternal order and disorder (due to the degrees of the competitiveness of\\nexisting powers in \\x00ghting for wealth and power). I hope you will join me\\nin trying to understand these three cycles and know where countries are in them.\\nHistory and logic show that when a country simultaneously has all three in their\\ngood phases it is strong and rising, and when all three are in their bad phases it is\\nweak and declining.\\nIf I were to add two more determinants to keep in mind, they would\\nbe 4) the pace of innovation and technological development to solve\\nproblems and make improvements and 5) acts of nature, most\\nimportantly droughts, \\x00oods, and diseases. That is because innovationand technological advances can solve most problems and further\\nevolution, and acts of nature such as droughts, \\x00oods, and diseases have\\nhad enormous impacts throughout history. These are the \\x00ve most\\nimportant forces, which I call the “Big Five,” so when they are moving in\\nthe same direction—toward improving or toward worsening—most\\neverything else follows.\\nI also introduced the eight powers that I could measure that seemed to\\nbe the most important. You can review them along with the big cycles in\\nthe following list. These indicators both re\\x00ect and drive the upswings and\\ndownswings. The chart of the archetypical rise and decline by factor in Chapter\\n1 showed the average readings of these along the path of the archetypical cycle.\\nEach of these types of power rising and declining in cycles comes together with\\nthe other cycles to make the one Big Cycle of the empire’s rise and decline.\\nAnd then there are the other determinants such as geology/geography,\\nrule of law, and infrastructure that matter too. The whole list of 18\\nfactors1 included in my model is shown on the next page. You can also read\\na detailed description of all 18 at the end of Chapter 14.I \\x00nd measuring and weighing all these things in my head, plus all of the\\nother important dynamics at play, to be impossible. That is why I analyze them\\nwith the aid of a computer. I will share my analysis for the top 11 countries inthe appendix after Chapter 14: The Future. I also provide detail on some\\ncomponents for the top 20 countries at economicprinciples.org.\\nThough none of these determinants is determinative on its own, I\\nthink you will \\x00nd that when considered together they paint a pretty\\nclear picture of which part of its life cycle a country is in and the\\ndirection it is headed in. For the fun of it you might want to go through a\\nlittle exercise of ticking o\\x00 where each of those measures is for each country\\nyou’re interested in. Rank each country on a 1–10 scale for each attribute,\\nbeginning with 10 on the far left and 1 on the far right. If you add all these\\nrankings up, the higher the number, the greater the probability of the country\\nrising on a relative basis. The lower the number, the more likely it will fall. Take a\\nmoment to calculate where the United States is, where China is, where Italy is,\\nwhere Brazil is, and so on.\\nBecause I systematize as much as I can, I push to quantify whatever possible\\ninto a decision-making system. So, with the help of my team, I have developed\\ngauges that look at things like internal and external con\\x00ict, political gaps, etc.,\\nto help me better understand where countries are in their cycles. Some of the less\\nkey determinants are aggregated as subcomponents of the key determinants.\\nWhile I measure and describe the determinants discretely, they are not\\nseparate. They interact with each other and blend together, typically\\nreinforcing each other and the whole cycle’s rise and fall. For example,\\nstronger education leads to stronger technological innovation, which leads to\\nincreased productivity and increased shares of trade, greater wealth, more\\nmilitary power, and eventually the establishment of a reserve currency. Further,\\nhaving strong leaders, a population that is well-educated and civil with each\\nother, a system that e\\x00ciently allocates capital and other resources, access to\\nnatural resources, and favorable geography all help a lot, and when they decline,\\nthey tend to decline together.\\nOf course, not all of the indicators can be expressed in numbers and\\nequations; things like human nature and the power dynamics that a\\x00ect\\nbehaviors and outcomes are better described in words. I call these things\\ndynamics. The following table shows a list of other main dynamics that I keep inmy head while trying to evaluate where nations are and what is likely to come\\nnext.\\nThat’s a lot. It is both too little and too much—to o little to do full justice to\\nthe subjects (which have all been the focus of whole books and doctoral theses)\\nand too much to process and digest. I have tried to cram a small portion of whatI’ve learned about them into the summaries that follow. Fuller accounts of a\\nnumber of these dynamics are contained in an addendum immediately following\\nthis chapter if you’re interested in diving more deeply into any of them. While\\nI’m sure that what follows doesn’t include all the most important\\ndeterminants, I also know that the ones I’m highlighting here and in the\\nfollowing chapters represent the most important in\\x00uences that have\\nrepeatedly driven the most important events throughout history. Of\\ncourse, I look forward to being corrected and guided by others to make my\\ndescriptions more complete.\\nEXPLORING THE DETERMINANTS AND\\nDYNAMICS\\nI \\x00nd that knowing the di\\x00erent circumstances countries face, as well as the\\nstrategies and group dynamics they bring to facing these circumstances, helps\\nme understand what moves are likely to come next and how these moves will\\nimpact the key determinants. I will explain a bit more about how these look to\\nme, which I will do by examining the machine from the top down.\\nAs I see it, the determinants and dynamics that drive events fall into\\ntwo types:\\n1. Inherited Determinants: They include a country’s geography, geology,\\nand acts of nature such as weather and diseases.\\n2. Human Capital Determinants: They are the ways people are with\\nthemselves and each other. They are driven by human nature and di\\x00erent\\ncultures (which di\\x00erentiate their approaches).\\nThese two big categories contain within them many important factors,\\nranging from qualities that are highly speci\\x00c to countries (like their geography)\\nto those that are universal (like the human tendency to favor short-termgrati\\x00cation over long-term goals), and they can be discerned at every level,\\nwhether in individuals, cities, countries, or empires.\\nINHERITED DETERMINANTS\\nBy inherited determinants of a country’s well-being I mean its geography,\\ngeology, genealogy, and acts of nature. These are big drivers of each country’s\\nand each people’s stories. For example, you can’t understand the success of the\\nUnited States without recognizing that it is separated from European and Asian\\npowers by two oceans and blessed with most of the minerals, metals, and other\\nnatural resources it needs to be prosperous and self-su\\x00cient, including the\\ntopsoil, water, and temperate climate that allows it to produce most of its own\\nfood. These factors enabled it to be largely isolationist until a little more than a\\ncentury ago while investing in education, infrastructure, and innovation in ways\\nthat made it strong. Let’s brie\\x00y review those.\\n1. Geography. Where a country is, what’s around it, and what its terrain\\nis like are all important determinants. For example, the geographies of the\\nUnited States and China—both with large expanses of land bounded by large\\nnatural barriers of water and mountains—created the inclination for them to be\\none big whole, increasing the commonalities of their people (e.g., shared\\nlanguage, government, culture, etc.). In contrast, the geography of Europe (i.e.,\\nhaving many more natural boundaries within it) reinforced its divisions into\\ndi\\x00erent states/countries, leading to fewer commonalities among its people (e.g.,\\ndi\\x00erent languages, governments, cultures, etc.).\\n2. Geology. The natural resources on and under a country’s surface are\\ncritically important, but geology should not be overvalued relative to human\\ncapital. History shows us that every commodity has declined in value (in\\nin\\x00ation-adjusted terms) with big up and down cycles around that downtrend.\\nThat is because inventiveness changes what is in demand—e.g., new energysources replacing old ones, \\x00ber-optic cable replacing copper wiring, etc.—and\\nnatural resources are depleted over time. Many Middle Eastern countries’ wealth,\\npower, and relevance to the rest of the world rose with the importance of\\npetroleum and may fall as the world turns away from fossil fuels. The most\\nvulnerable position to be in is having a high reliance on one or a few\\ncommodities because they are highly cyclical and sometimes lose value\\naltogether.\\n3. Acts of Nature. Acts of nature come in many forms, such as epidemic\\ndiseases, \\x00oods, and droughts. Throughout history they have a\\x00ected the\\nwell-being of countries and the course of their evolution even more than\\nwars and depressions. The Black Death killed an estimated 75–200 million\\npeople in the years around 1350, and smallpox killed more than 300 million\\npeople in the 20th century, which is more than double the number that died in\\nits wars. Droughts and \\x00oods have caused massive famines and loss of life. Such\\ncatastrophes tend to come along unexpectedly and act as stress tests, revealing\\nthe underlying strengths and weaknesses of societies.\\n4. Genealogy. Regarding genealogy, I’m no expert on genetics, so I have\\nlittle to o\\x00er other than to say that all people come into this world with\\ninherited genes that a\\x00ect how they behave to some extent, so it is logical\\nthat the genetic makeup of a country’s population should have some\\ne\\x00ect on its outcomes. Having said that, I should point out that most of the\\nevidence I have seen indicates that only a small percentage (15 percent or less) of\\nthe variations in the behaviors of people between populations could potentially\\nbe explained by genetic di\\x00erences, so genetics seems to be a relatively minor\\ndeterminant in relation to the other in\\x00uences I am mentioning.\\nHUMAN CAPITAL DETERMINANTS While the inherited assets and liabilities of a countr y are very impor tant, hist ory has shown\\nthat the way people  are with themselv es and others is the most impor tant determinant.  By\\nthat I mean whether they hold themselves to high standards of behavior,\\nwhether they are self-disciplined, and whether they are civil with others in order\\nto be productive members of their societies is most important. These qualities\\nplus \\x00exibility and resilience (i.e., the capacity to adapt to both “bad” and\\n“good” things) allows people to minimize setbacks and maximize opportunities.\\nCharacter, common sense, creativity, and consideration in most people make for\\na productive society.\\nBecause capital is an income-producing asset, human capital can be de\\x00ned as\\na human who generates income. \\n When humans have the capacity to produce more\\nrevenue than they expend, there is good human capital and self-suﬃciency . I call this\\n“self-su\\x00cient plus,” which is what all people, companies, and countries should\\nstrive for in order for them individually and collectively to be strong \\x00nancially.\\nThe likelihood of having good human capital and being “self-su\\x00cient plus” is\\nimproved through quality education, a culture of hard work and cooperation,\\ntraining, etc. Societies that don’t have good human capital are either drawing\\ndown their resources or getting deeper into debt they won’t be able to pay back\\n(i.e., they’re headed for trouble).\\n While man y countri es have natur al resour ces that they are able to draw upon, human\\ncapital is the most sustainable capital because inherited assets that are drawn down\\neventually disappear , wher eas human capital can exist for ever.\\nHuman capital is why people who come up with new ideas and build them\\nout (e.g., entrepreneurs) beat giants with vast resources (just look at Elon Musk\\nand his startup Tesla, which rivals resource-rich General Motors, Ford, and\\nChrysler; or Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, whose computer startups surpassed giants\\nlike IBM; and so on). Great human capital allows people to overcome their\\nweaknesses and identify and capitalize on their opportunities. It is the attribute\\nthat has allowed small countries like the Netherlands, England, Switzerland, and\\nSingapore to achieve great wealth and (in some cases) power.THE MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN NATURE\\nDETERMINANTS\\nAcross societies and throughout time, people share the same human nature,\\nwhich makes them much more alike than di\\x00erent. People behave similarly\\nwhen faced with similar circumstances, driving the Big Cycles.\\n5. Self-Interest. Self-interest, especially self-survival, is the most powerful\\nmotivator for most people, organizations, and governments. However,\\nwhich self-interest—e.g., the individual’s, the family’s, the country’s, etc.\\n—matters most is a critical determinant of the society’s success. See the\\naddendum that follows this chapter to learn more.\\n6. The Drive to Gain and Keep Wealth and Power. The quest for wealth\\nand power is a powerful motivator of individuals, families, companies, states,\\nand countries, though that’s not totally true because di\\x00erent individuals,\\nfamilies, companies, states, and countries value wealth and power di\\x00erently\\nrelative to other things. For some, wealth and power are not nearly as important\\nas other things that life has to o\\x00er. But for most, especially those who become\\nthe most wealthy and powerful, the pursuit of wealth and power is all-\\nconsuming. To be successful over the long run, a country must earn an\\namount that is at least equal to what it spends. Those that earn and\\nspend modestly and have a surplus are more sustainably successful than\\nthose that earn and spend a lot more and have de\\x00cits. History shows\\nthat when an individual, organization, country, or empire spends more\\nthan what it earns, misery and turbulence are ahead. For more, see the\\naddendum.\\n7. Capital Markets. The ability to save and obtain buying power through\\none’s capital markets is essential to a country’s well-being. For that reason,\\nhow well they are developed is an important determinant of a country’s success.8. The Ability to Learn from History. Most people don’t have this, which is\\nan impediment, though it varies by society. For example, the Chinese are\\nexcellent at this. Learning from one’s own experiences is not adequate because,\\nas explained earlier, many of the most important lessons don’t come in one’s\\nlifetime. In fact, many encounters in the future will be more opposite than\\nsimilar to what one encountered before in life. Since the peace/boom period at\\nthe beginning of the cycle is opposite to the war/bust period at its end, the\\nperiods people face later in their lives are more likely to be more opposite than\\nsimilar to the ones they encountered earlier in their lives. More speci\\x00cally, in my\\nopinion, if you don’t understand what happened since at least 1900 and how\\nthat rhymes with what is happening now, there is a high likelihood that you will\\n\\x00nd yourself in trouble.\\n9. The Big Multigenerational Psychological Cycle. Di\\x00erent generations\\nthink di\\x00erently because of their di\\x00erent experiences, which leads them\\nto make their decisions di\\x00erently, which a\\x00ects what happens to them\\nand to subsequent generations. This is re\\x00ected in the adage “from\\nshirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.” Three generations is also\\nroughly the length of time of a typical long-term debt cycle. However, history\\nshows that when these cycles are handled well—i.e., strong human capital is\\nmaintained over many generations—they can go on for many generations. This\\nmultigenerational cycle takes place over several stages that are described in the\\naddendum to this chapter.\\n10. Favoring Short-Term Grati\\x00cation over Long-Term Well-Being. This\\nis another di\\x00erentiator of people’s and society’s successes. Those who favor\\nlong-term well-being over short-term well-being tend to do better. The human\\npropensity to choose short-term enjoyment over long-term well-being naturally\\nexaggerates the highs and lows of the cycle because it pulls the good times\\nforward at the expense of the future. That happens in many harmful ways, most\\nclassically by creating the debt boom and bust cycle. Governments are especially\\nvulnerable to this because of how the political dynamic works. More speci\\x00cally,a) politicians are motivated to prioritize the near term over the long term, b) they\\ndon’t like to face limitations and di\\x00cult \\x00nancial trade-o\\x00s (e.g., choosing\\nwhether to spend on the military for defense or to spend on social programs),\\nand c) it is politically threatening to take money away from people by taxing\\nthem. This leads to a host of political and other problems.\\n11. Humanity’s Inventiveness. Humanity’s greatest power is what drives\\nhuman evolution, which is manifest in increased productivity and higher\\nliving standards. Unlike other species, humans have a unique capacity to learn\\nand evolve their intellectual understanding; plus, they invent things that\\nmaterially change their circumstances, producing advances in everything. These\\nadvances produce the upward trending corkscrew I described in Chapter 1. To\\nimagine what it would be like if humankind didn’t have this ability, look at other\\nspecies. Without humanity’s unique ability to invent, our lives would be pretty\\nmuch the same generation after generation. Because there would be far fewer\\nnew things, there would be fewer surprises and advances. In fact, some periods\\nof human history were very much like that. However, it varies greatly from one\\nsociety to another. For more, see the addendum to this chapter.\\nDETERMINANTS SHAPED BY CULTURE\\n12. Culture. As the saying goes, “culture is destiny.” Cultural di\\x00erences\\n—di\\x00erences in how people believe they should be with each other—\\nmatter enormously. All societies create cultures based on how they think\\nreality works, and they all provide principles for guiding how people\\nshould deal with reality, and most importantly how they should deal\\nwith each other. Culture drives the formal and informal ways each society\\nworks. Individuals known and unknown, such as Jesus, Confucius,\\nMohammed, Buddha, Mahavira, Guru Nanak, Plato, Socrates, Marx, and many\\nothers, have conveyed approaches to life that were captured in books such as the\\nHebrew Bible and the New Testament, the Talmud, the Quran, the I Ching, theFive Books and Four Classics, the Analects, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita,\\nthe Brama Sutras, Meditations, Republic, Metaphysics, The Wealth of Nations,\\nand Das Kapital. These, together with the discoveries of scientists, artists,\\npoliticians, diplomats, investors, psychologists, etc., all encountering their\\nrealities and adapting to them in their own ways, are what determines a people’s\\nculture.\\n13. Openness to Global Thinking. This is a good leading indicator of\\nstrength because isolated entities tend to miss out on the world’s best\\npractices, which weakens them, while learning about the best the world\\nhas to o\\x00er helps people be their best. Isolation also prevents them from\\nbene\\x00ting from the challenge of facing o\\x00 against the world’s best competitors.\\nHistory is littered with cases in which countries were isolated, sometimes\\nbecause they chose to cut themselves o\\x00 to protect their cultures (e.g., the late\\nTang, late Ming, and early PRC periods in China, and the Edo period in Japan)\\nand sometimes because of circumstances like natural disasters and internal\\n\\x00ghting. Both reasons lead them to fall behind in their technology, with terrible\\nconsequences. In fact, it is one of the most common reasons for empires and\\ndynasties failing.\\n14. Leadership. Everything I’ve mentioned so far is in\\x00uenced by the people in\\nleadership positions. Life is like a game of chess or the Chinese board game Go,\\nin which every move helps determine the outcome and some players know how\\nto make better moves than others. In the future, more and more of those moves\\nwill be made with the aid of computers, but for now they are still made by\\npeople. In reading history you see over and over how its course has been changed\\nby the uniqueness—sometimes excellence, sometimes terribleness—of a\\nrelatively few people in key areas such as the government, the sciences, \\x00nance\\nand commerce, the arts, and so on. In each generation, roughly a few hundred\\npeople made all the di\\x00erence. Studying what these key people in these key roles\\nwere like, what they did in di\\x00erent situations, and the consequences of what\\nthey did helps us understand how this perpetual-motion machine works.DETERMINANTS SHAPED BY HOW\\nINDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS INTERACT WITH\\nEACH OTHER\\n15. Wealth Gaps. Large and widening wealth gaps tend to lead to periods of\\ngreater con\\x00ict, especially when economic conditions become bad and people\\nare \\x00ghting over a shrinking pie.\\n16. Values Gaps. While wealth matters, it is not the only thing that people \\x00ght\\nover. Values (e.g., in religions and ideologies) matter a lot too. History shows us\\nthat widening values gaps, especially during periods of economic stress, have\\ntended to lead to periods of greater con\\x00ict, while shrinking values gaps tend to\\nlead to periods of greater harmony. This dynamic is driven by the fact that\\npeople tend to coalesce into tribes that are bound together (often informally) by\\nthe magnetism of their members’ commonalities. Naturally, such tribes operate\\nwith each other in ways that are consistent with their shared values. When under\\nstress, people with greater values gaps also prove to have greater con\\x00ict. They\\nfrequently demonize members of other tribes rather than recognizing that those\\nother tribes, like themselves, are simply doing what is in their self-interest in the\\nbest ways they know how.\\n17. Class Struggles. \\n In all countries throughout time, though to varying degr ees,\\npeople are sorted into “classes, ” either because they choose to be with people like\\nthemselv es or because others assign them to a class.  Power is usually shared among\\nthree or four classes who in aggregate make up only a small percentage of the\\npopulation. The classes people are in typically determine who their friends and\\nallies are and who their enemies are. They are sorted into these classes whether\\nthey like it or not because people stereotype. While rich and poor are the most\\ncommon class distinctions, there are many other important ones, such as race,\\nethnicity, religion, gender, lifestyle, location (e.g., urban versus rural), and\\npolitics (right versus left). Early in the Big Cycle, when times are good, there is\\ngenerally more harmony among the classes, and when things are bad toward theend, there is more \\x00ghting. Class warfare has profound e\\x00ects on the\\ninternal order, which I will explore in Chapter 5. For more on this\\ndeterminant, see the addendum to this chapter.\\n18. The Political Left/Right Cycle. In all societies there are swings between\\nthe political left and the political right that determine how wealth and power are\\ndistributed. The swings are sometimes peaceful and sometimes violent and are\\nalways important to understand. Typically, the big cycle in the capital markets,\\nalong with cycles in wealth, values, and class divisions, drive the political\\nleft/right cycle because these create the motivations for political change. When\\ncapital markets and economies are booming, wealth gaps typically increase.\\nWhile some societies succeed at striking a relatively sensible and steady balance\\nbetween left and right, more frequently we see cyclical swings between norms.\\nThese swings typically occur throughout empires’ rises and declines, in roughly\\n10-year cycles. The big economic crises that mark the end of the Big Cycle often\\nherald revolutions. For more, see the addendum to this chapter.\\n19. The Prisoner’s Dilemma Must Be Solved for Peace to Exist. The\\nprisoner’s dilemma is a concept from game theory that explains why, even when\\nthe best thing for two parties to do is to cooperate, the logical thing for each to\\ndo is to kill the other \\x00rst. That is because survival is of paramount importance,\\nand while you don’t know for certain if your opponent will attack you, you do\\nknow that it is in their interest to defeat you before you defeat them. It’s for this\\nreason that deadly wars are best avoided by both sides establishing mutually\\nassured protections against existential harms. Exchanging bene\\x00ts and creating\\ninterdependencies that would be intolerable to lose further reduces the risk of\\ncon\\x00ict.\\n20. Whether There Are Win-Win Relationships or Lose-Lose\\nRelationships. It is up to both parties to choose what kind of relationship they\\nhave. That is true at all levels of relationships, from individuals up to countries.\\nMost fundamentally, parties can choose whether to have a cooperative win-winrelationship or a threatening lose-lose relationship—i.e., to be allies or enemies—\\nthough actions by both determine what type of relationship they will have and\\nwhether it will work well. To be clear, win-win relationships can exist between\\ncompetitors as long as each side does not pose an existential risk to the other (see\\nthe prisoner’s dilemma). All that’s required is that they know and respect each\\nother’s existential red lines. Parties in win-win relationships can have tough\\nnegotiations, competing like two friendly merchants in a bazaar or two teams at\\nthe Olympics. Having win-win relationships is obviously better than having\\nlose-lose relationships, but sometimes there are irreconcilable di\\x00erences that\\nmust be fought over because they can’t be negotiated away.\\n21. The Big Balance of Power Cycle That Drives the Big Peace/War Cycle\\nBoth Within Countries and Between Countries. The balance of power\\ndynamic is the timeless and universal dynamic of allies and enemies working to\\ngain wealth and power. It drives virtually all struggles for power, from o\\x00ce\\npolitics to local politics, and from national politics to geopolitics. In some\\ncultures this game is played a bit di\\x00erently than in other cultures—e.g., in\\nWestern society it is played more like chess while in Asian societies it is played\\nmore like Go—though the objective is the same: to dominate the other side. It\\nhas always existed and still exists everywhere and appears to transpire along a\\nconsistent series of steps, which I describe in more detail when discussing the\\ninternal order in Chapter 5 (even though these same forces apply equally to\\ninternal and external power struggles). For a more complete explanation of how\\nthe balance of power cycle works, see the addendum to this chapter.\\n22. Military Strength and the Peace/War Cycle. History shows us that\\nmilitary strength—whether one’s own or another’s via alliances—is a critical\\ndeterminant of outcomes, sometimes because the mere threat of force is power\\nand sometimes because the use of force is required. Military strength is readily\\nobservable and measurable, but it can also be qualitatively assessed.\\nInternationally, military strength is especially important because there is no\\ne\\x00ective international judicial and enforcement system. This leads to countriesneeding to \\x00ght to test their relative powers and a cycle of war and peace that I\\nwill explain when discussing the external order cycle in Chapter 6.\\nALL THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER TO\\nDETERMINE INTERNAL ORDERS, EXTERNAL\\nORDERS, AND HOW THEY CHANGE\\nI have repeatedly seen all of these determine the levels and the rises and declines\\nin wealth and power of all peoples. I have seen them together create the\\ncircumstances the people of a country and/or its leaders face and how they face\\nthem. They drive the internal and world orders and changes in them.\\n Like everything else, internal orders and world orders are constantly evolving and\\nmoving circumstan ces forward through time, as existing circumstances inter act with each\\nother and the for ces that act on them t o produce new cir cumstances.\\nEvolution occurs because of logical cause/e\\x00ect relationships in which\\nexisting conditions and determinants propel changes that create a new set of\\nconditions and determinants that propel the next changes and so on, like matter\\nand energy interacting in a perpetual-motion machine. Because a given set of\\ncircumstances creates a limited set of possibilities, by properly identifying the\\ncircumstances and understanding the cause/e\\x00ect relationships, one can\\nimprove one’s understanding of the possibilities of what will come next and how\\nto make wise decisions.\\nFor example, all countries now have their existing way of choosing new\\nleaders. In the US, the president is chosen both by the voters in accordance with\\nthe democratic system laid out in the Constitution and by how people choose to\\noperate within the system. How well this works depends on how e\\x00ective both\\nare, which is a result of prior determinants, such as how e\\x00ectively those in\\nprevious generations dealt with and modi\\x00ed the system. The people now\\ninteracting with the system are di\\x00erent from those of previous generations,\\nwho were shaped by di\\x00erent circumstances, so we should expect di\\x00erent\\noutcomes based on how people today are di\\x00erent.Not having the historical perspective to recognize those di\\x00erences is a\\nhandicap. Once we see them and understand how the perpetual-motion\\nmachine works, we can see how di\\x00erent systems such as communism, fascism,\\nautocracies, democracies, and evolutionary descendants and hybrids of these,\\nsuch as state capitalism in China, evolve through time. Seeing this, we can\\nimagine how new forms of internal orders to divide wealth and allocate\\ngovernment political power may evolve and a\\x00ect our lives, based on how people\\nchoose to be with each other and how human nature enters into their choices.\\nNow that I have described my mental model of how the world works rather\\nsuper\\x00cially, in the rest of Part I, I will focus on the most important\\ndeterminants—namely the three big cycles of debt and capital markets, internal\\norder, and external order—in more detail. I will also describe what I believe all\\nthis means for investing. Before you go on to that, you might want to look over\\nthe addendum to this chapter, which \\x00eshes out some of the determinants that I\\nonly brie\\x00y covered in this chapter. On the other hand, if you’re feeling bogged\\ndown, you can skip it. That’s why I made it an addendum.\\n1 I want to clarify the di\\x00erence between a determinant and a cycle because sometimes I will use these terms\\nin ways that might not be clear. A determinant is a factor (e.g., the supply of money) while a cycle is a series\\nof self-reinforcing determinants that lead to events transpiring in a certain way—e.g., central banks making\\nlots of money and credit available eventually leads to strong economic growth, in\\x00ation, and bubbles,\\nwhich then prompt central banks to reduce the money supply, which produces market and economic\\ndownturns, which then lead the central banks to increase the supply of money to… etc. So, cycles\\nthemselves are determinants that are a collection of complementary forces that interact in a process to\\nproduce the same results again and again through time.CHAPTER 2\\nDETERMINANTS ADDENDUM\\nIn Chapter 2 I introduced some concepts that I thought might be worth\\nexplaining in greater depth but didn’t want to include in the body of the chapter\\nbecause these explorations could be too much, so I decided to include them here\\nas an addendum in case you are interested in exploring them further. To help\\nyou make the connection I refer to each determinant or dynamic by title and\\nnumber from Chapter 2.\\n5. Self-Interest. While self-interest is the primary motivator for most\\npeople, organizations, and governments, the question of which “self” is\\nmost important—is it the individual, the family, the tribe (i.e.,\\ncommunity), the state, the country, the empire, humankind, all living\\nthings, the universe? The following diagram shows the possible units. The\\nones on the top are more encompassing and the ones on the bottom are the less\\nconsolidated. What are most people in your society, and what are you,\\nwilling to die for?The “self” that people are most attached to is the one they will do the\\nmost to protect and this will drive their behaviors. For example, when\\npeople are willing to die for their country, their country will be more likely to beprotected than if the individual self is more important, in which case individuals\\nwill run from deadly combat. Within countries one might see tribes be much\\nmore important than countries, which would lead to an entirely di\\x00erent\\ndynamic than if the opposite were true. That is why I \\x00nd this dynamic worth\\nkeeping an eye on, especially in con\\x00icts.\\nIn looking at history across countries I saw changes in the primary unit\\nthat most people and societies optimized for. For example, before around\\n16501 tribes and states were more important than countries. History shows that\\nthe groupings that people collect in and that are the most important to them\\nevolve. Gatherings of individuals and families make up a tribe (i.e., a\\ncommunity); gatherings of tribes (or communities) make up a state (e.g., the\\nstate of Georgia); gatherings of states make up a country (e.g., the United States);\\ngatherings of states or countries that are under uni\\x00ed control make up an\\nempire (e.g., the British Empire). Sometimes smaller groupings coalesce into\\nbigger ones, changing boundaries in the process. For example, over the last 150\\nyears in Europe, states coalesced into nations, many of which have coalesced into\\nthe European Union. And sometimes they break up into smaller units. For\\nexample, the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent countries, and some\\nMiddle Eastern countries have broken up into warring tribes.\\nOver the last few years, the world has been moving from being more globalist\\nto being more nationalist. At the same time, the United States appears to be\\nlosing its cohesion as people’s views about how they should be with each other\\nare becoming more divergent. These divergences are leading people to migrate to\\nthe states that align with their preferences, causing those states to be more\\nrelevant individually than as parts of a uni\\x00ed whole. History and logic show us\\nthat these changes in domestic and international orders are typically\\naccompanied by con\\x00icts because there is a lot of disagreement about how they\\nshould work—e.g., what states’ rights are relative to national rights. Because\\nmost people haven’t seen such changes before, they fail to recognize them for\\nwhat they are. They are important to stay on top of because they show the\\nchanging locus of control, which typically signals a change in one’s rights and\\nobligations.Think about it. What are you seeing happen? Are you seeing\\ncoalescing or dissolving? From what level to what other level? What\\nimplications do these changes have for you and where you want to be?\\n6. The Drive to Gain and Keep Wealth and Power. For the purposes of\\ndiscussing the big cycles in later chapters, it’s worth de\\x00ning wealth a bit more\\nspeci\\x00cally and looking at its impact on countries that have it or lack it. I believe\\nthe following to be by and large true:\\nWealth = Buying Power. Without getting too nuanced, let’s call wealth\\nbuying power to distinguish it from money and credit. That distinction is\\nimportant because the value of money and credit changes. For example, when a\\nlot of money and credit are created, they go down in value, so having more\\nmoney won’t necessarily give one more wealth or buying power.\\nReal Wealth ≠ Financial Wealth. Real wealth is what people buy because\\nthey want to have and use it, such as a house, car, streaming video service, etc.\\nReal wealth has intrinsic value. Financial wealth consists of \\x00nancial assets that\\nare held to a) receive an ongoing income in the future and/or b) be sold in the\\nfuture to get money to buy the real assets people will want. Financial wealth has\\nno intrinsic value.\\nMaking Wealth = Being Productive. Over the long run the wealth and\\nbuying power you have will be a function of how much you produce. That is\\nbecause real wealth doesn’t last long and neither do inheritances. That is why\\nbeing continuously productive is so important. If you look at societies that\\nexpropriated the wealth of the rich and tried to live o\\x00 it and weren’t productive\\n(e.g., Russia after the revolutions of 1917), you will see that it didn’t take them\\nlong to become poor. The less productive a society, the less wealthy and hence\\nthe less powerful. By the way, spending money on investment and infrastructure\\nrather than on consumption tends to lead to greater productivity, so investment\\nis a good leading indicator of prosperity.Wealth = Power. That is because if one has enough wealth one can buy\\nmost anything—physical property, the work and loyalty of others, education,\\nhealthcare, in\\x00uential powers of all sorts (political, military, etc.), and so on.\\nThrough time and across countries, history has shown that there is a symbiotic\\nrelationship between those who have wealth and those who have political power,\\nand that the type of deal they have between them determines the ruling order.\\nThat ruling order continues until the rulers are overthrown by others who grab\\nthe wealth and power for themselves.\\nWealth and power are mutually supportive. For example, in 1717 the British\\nEast India Company e\\x00ectively brought together \\x00nancial capital, people with\\ncommercial capabilities, and people with military capabilities to force India’s\\nMughal emperor to trade with them, which was the \\x00rst step toward the British\\ncolonization of India, the fall of the Mughal Empire in the 18th century, and\\nthen its complete failure in the 19th century, when the British exiled the\\nemperor and executed his children after the 1857 Indian Rebellion. The British\\ndid these things because they had the wealth and power to do them in pursuit of\\nmore wealth and power.\\nWealth Decline = Power Decline. There isn’t an individual, organization,\\ncountry, or empire that hasn’t failed when it lost its buying power. \\n To be\\nsuccessful one must earn an amount that is at least equal to the amount one spends.\\nThose who spend modestly and have a surplus are more sustainably successful\\nthan those who earn a lot more and have de\\x00cits. History shows that when an\\nindividual, organization, country, or empire spends more than what they earn,\\nmisery and turbulence are ahead. History also shows that countries that have\\nhigher percentages of people who are self-su\\x00cient tend to be more socially,\\npolitically, and economically stable.\\n9. The Big Multigenerational Psychological Cycle. The rises and declines of\\ncountries correspond to these psychological and economic cycles in the\\nfollowing ways and stages. Because these stages are so useful in understandingthe behavior of a country’s people and leaders, I am always trying to assess what\\nstages di\\x00erent countries are in.\\nStage 1: People and Their Countries Are Poor and They Think of\\nThemselves as Poor. In this stage, most people have very low incomes and\\nsubsistence lifestyles. As a result they don’t waste money because they value it a\\nlot, and they don’t have much debt because nobody wants to lend to them.\\nSome people have potential and some do not, but in most cases their poverty\\nand lack of resources prevent them from gaining the education and other\\ncapabilities that would allow them to pull themselves up. One’s inherited\\ncircumstances and approach to life are the biggest determinants of who emerges\\nricher from this stage and who does not.\\nHow fast countries evolve through this stage depends on their cultures and\\ntheir abilities. I call countries in this stage “early-stage emerging\\ncountries.” Those that advance typically work hard and gradually accumulate\\nmore money than they need to survive, which they save because they worry\\nabout not having enough in the future. The evolution through this stage to the\\nnext typically takes about a generation. Starting about 40 years ago until about\\n10 to 15 years ago the “Asian Tigers” of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and\\nSouth Korea and then China were examples of economies in this stage.\\nStage 2: People and Their Countries Are Rich but Still Think of\\nThemselves as Poor. Because people who grew up with \\x00nancial insecurity\\ntypically don’t lose their \\x00nancial cautiousness, people in this stage still work\\nhard, sell a lot to foreigners, have pegged exchange rates, save a lot, and invest\\ne\\x00ciently in real assets like real estate, gold, and local bank deposits, and in\\nbonds of the reserve currency countries. Because they have a lot more money,\\nthey can and do invest in the things that make them more productive—e.g.,\\nhuman capital development, infrastructure, research and development, etc. This\\ngeneration of parents wants to educate their children well and get them to work\\nhard to be successful. They also improve their resource-allocation systems,including their capital markets and their legal systems. This is the most\\nproductive phase of the cycle.\\nCountries in this stage experience rapidly rising income growth and rapidly\\nrising productivity growth at the same time. The productivity growth means\\ntwo things: 1) in\\x00ation is not a problem and 2) the country can become more\\ncompetitive. During this stage, debts typically do not rise signi\\x00cantly relative to\\nincomes and sometimes they decline. This is a very healthy period and a terri\\x00c\\ntime to invest in a country if it has adequate property rights protections.\\nYou can tell countries in this stage from those in the \\x00rst stage because they\\nhave gleaming new cities next to old ones, high savings rates, rapidly rising\\nincomes, and, typically, rising foreign exchange reserves. I call countries in this\\nstage “late-stage emerging countries.” While countries of all sizes can go\\nthrough this stage, when big countries go through it, they are typically emerging\\ninto great world powers.\\nStage 3: People and Their Countries Are Rich and Think of\\nThemselves as Rich. At this stage, people’s incomes are high, so labor becomes\\nmore expensive. But their prior investments in infrastructure, capital goods, and\\nresearch and development are still paying o\\x00 by producing productivity gains\\nthat sustain their high living standards. Priorities shift from an emphasis on\\nworking and saving in order to protect oneself from bad times, to savoring the\\n\\x00ner things in life. People become more comfortable spending more. Arts and\\nsciences typically \\x00ourish. This change in the prevailing psychology is reinforced\\nas a new generation of people who did not experience the bad times become an\\nincreasingly large percentage of the population. Signs of this change in mindset\\nare re\\x00ected in statistics that show reduced work hours (e.g., typically there is a\\nreduction in the workweek from six days to \\x00ve) and big increases in\\nexpenditures on leisure and luxury goods relative to necessities. At their best,\\nthese periods are early- and mid-stage “Renaissance periods.”\\nLarge countries in this stage almost always become world economic and\\nmilitary powers.2 Typically, they develop their militaries in order to project and\\nprotect their global interests. Prior to the mid-20th century, large countries at\\nthis stage literally controlled foreign governments and created empires fromthem to provide the cheap labor and cheap natural resources they needed to\\nremain competitive. Starting in the early to mid-20th century, when the US\\nEmpire began ruling by “speaking softly and carrying a big stick,” American\\n“in\\x00uence” and international agreements have allowed developed countries to\\nhave access to emerging countries’ cheap labor and investment opportunities\\nwithout directly controlling their governments. In this stage countries are on top\\nof the world and are enjoying it. I call countries in this stage “peak health\\ncountries.” The United States was in this stage from 1950 to 1965. China\\nis now moving into it. The key is to maintain the determinants leading to\\nstrength for as long as possible.\\nStage 4: People and Their Countries Are Poorer and Still Think of\\nThemselves as Rich. In this stage, debts rise relative to income. The\\npsychological shift behind this leveraging up occurs because the people who\\nlived through the \\x00rst two stages have died o\\x00 or become irrelevant and those\\nwhose behavior matters most are used to living well and not worrying about the\\npain of not having enough money. Because the workers in these countries earn\\nand spend a lot, they become expensive, and because they are expensive, they\\nexperience slower real income growth rates. Since they are reluctant to constrain\\ntheir spending in line with their reduced income growth rates, they lower their\\nsavings rates, increase their debts, and cut corners. Because their spending\\ncontinues to be strong, they continue to appear rich, even though their balance\\nsheets are deteriorating. The reduced level of e\\x00cient investments in\\ninfrastructure, capital goods, and research and development slows their\\nproductivity gains. Their cities and infrastructure become older and less e\\x00cient\\nthan in the two previous stages. They increasingly rely on their reputation rather\\nthan on their competitiveness to fund their de\\x00cits. Countries typically spend a\\nlot of money on the military at this stage to protect their global interests,\\nsometimes in very large amounts because of wars. Often, though not always,\\ncountries run “twin de\\x00cits”—i.e., both balance of payments and government\\nde\\x00cits. In the last few years of this stage, bubbles frequently occur.\\nWhether because of wars3 or bursting \\x00nancial bubbles or both, what typi\\x00es\\nthis stage is an accumulation of debt that can’t be paid back in non-depreciatedmoney. I call countries in this stage “early declining countries.” While\\ncountries of all sizes can go through this stage, when big countries go through it,\\nthey are typically approaching their decline as great empires.\\nStage 5: People and Their Countries Are Poor and They Think of\\nThemselves as Poor. This is when the gaps described in Stage 4 cease to exist\\nand the reality of the country’s situation is hitting home. After bubbles burst\\nand deleveragings occur, private debts grow, while private sector spending, asset\\nvalues, and net worths decline in a self-reinforcing negative cycle. To\\ncompensate, government debt and government de\\x00cits grow, and central bank\\n“printing” of money typically increases. Central banks and governments cut real\\ninterest rates and increase nominal GDP growth so that it is comfortably above\\nnominal interest rates in order to ease debt burdens. As a result of these low real\\ninterest rates, weak currencies, and poor economic conditions, their debt and\\nequity assets perform poorly. Increasingly, these countries have to compete with\\nless expensive countries that are in earlier stages of development. Their\\ncurrencies depreciate and they like it because it makes the deleveraging less\\npainful. As an extension of these economic and \\x00nancial trends, countries in this\\nstage see their power in the world decline further. I call countries in this stage\\n“clearly declined countries.” It typically takes a long time—if it ever happens\\n—for clearly declined empires’ psychologies and attributes to go through the full\\ncycle that brings them to their old peaks again. The Romans and the Greeks\\nnever have, though the Chinese have a few times.\\n11. Humanity’s Inventiveness. \\n Humanity ’s capacity to invent solutions to its\\nproblems and to identify how to mak e things better has proven to be far more power ful than\\nall of its problems combined.  Because knowledge is gained more than it is lost, it\\nadvances more in spurts and sputters than in cycles that have downs as well as\\nups. The spurts come when societies are in the upward swings of the Big Cycle\\nand the sputters come when they are in the downward swings. The Renaissance\\nperiods of great creativity that produce advances in just about all areas—the\\nsciences, the arts, philosophies about how people should be with each other andgovern, etc.—come more during the peaceful and prosperous parts of the Big\\nCycle, when the systems for creating innovations are good rather than bad.\\nWhile speci\\x00c inventions and the ways they come about have evolved\\nthrough time, they have unwaveringly evolved toward doing and making things\\nbetter, replacing manual labor with machines and automation, and making\\npeople around the world more interconnected. There are always new inventions\\nand improvements. The most important and undeniable trend of technological\\nadvancement has been toward higher living standards. That trend is likely to\\naccelerate in unimaginable ways. Beyond that, computerization is changing the\\ncharacter of decision making, making it faster and less emotional. As helpful as\\nthat is, it also poses certain dangers.\\n The degr ee of inventiv eness and inno vation in a society is the main driver of its\\nproductivity . An innovative and commercial spirit is the lifeblood of a thriving\\neconomy. Without innovation, productivity growth would grind to a halt.\\nInnovations that allow a country’s workers to produce more relative to the rest\\nof the world feed into their cost competitiveness, making them more attractive\\nplaces to do business.\\nThe drive to tinker and invent, to discover, to improve from prior failures—\\nthis is how people learn and \\x00nd new and better ways of creating things of value.\\nIn a market-based system, the most powerful way to drive innovation is to bring\\nnew ideas to market and to commercialize and pro\\x00t from them. The\\nmarketplace is incredibly e\\x00cient at weeding out bad ideas and pricing good\\nones. In this way the concepts of innovation and commercialism go hand in\\nhand. They capture whether people in a society value new knowledge and the\\ncreation of new things, and whether incentives are aligned to encourage them to\\nseek a pro\\x00t by commercializing them.\\nIn other words:\\n Inno vation + Commer cial Spirit + Thriving Capital Mark ets\\n=\\nGreat Pr oductivity Gains=\\nIncreases in W ealth and P ower\\nBecause there are big di\\x00erences in the strengths of these determinants, I try\\nto measure them and take them into consideration in my model.\\n17. Class Struggles. For as long as there has been recorded history, in\\nalmost all societies a very small percentage of the population (the “ruling\\nclasses” or “the elites”) have controlled most of the wealth and power\\n(though those percentages have varied).4 Naturally those who bene\\x00t from\\nand control the system by and large like the system and seek to maintain it.\\nBecause those with wealth can in\\x00uence those with power and because those\\nwith power can in\\x00uence those with wealth, these ruling classes or elites have\\nalliances among themselves and want to maintain the existing order with\\neveryone following its dictums and laws, even as the system increases the gaps\\nbetween those with power and wealth and those without them. As a result, all\\ninternal orders are run by certain classes of people who have wealth and power\\nand who operate in symbiotic relationships with each other to maintain the\\norder. Though aligned not to disrupt the order that bene\\x00ts them, throughout\\ntime these elites have struggled with each other over wealth and power and have\\nalso struggled with non-elites who want wealth and power. When times are good\\nand most people prosper, the struggles are smaller; when times are bad, the\\nstruggles are worse. And when things are very bad for a large percentage of the\\npeople—e.g., there is an unresolvable debt crisis, a very bad economy, a very bad\\nact of nature—the resulting su\\x00ering, stress, and struggles typically lead to\\nrevolutions and/or civil wars.\\nAs Aristotle said a long time ago: “The poor and the rich quarrel with\\none another, and whichever side gets the better, instead of establishing a\\njust or popular government, regards political supremacy as the prize of\\nvictory.”\\nClassically, the Big Cycle transpires with periods of peace and\\nproductivity that increase wealth in a disproportionate way, which leadsto a very small percentage of the population gaining and controlling\\nexceptionally large percentages of the wealth and power, then becoming\\noverextended, which leads to encountering bad times that hurt those\\nwho are the least wealthy and powerful the hardest, which then leads to\\ncon\\x00icts that produce revolutions and/or civil wars, which then lead to\\nthe creation of a new order and the cycle beginning again.\\n Throughout time and in all countries the people who have the wealth are the people\\nwho own the means of wealth production and, in order to maintain it, they work with the\\npeople who have the power to set and enfor ce the rules.  While that has always been the\\ncase, the exact form of it has evolved and will continue to evolve.\\nFor example, as explained in Chapter 1, for most of the 13th through 19th\\ncenturies, the prominent internal order all around the world consisted of the\\nruling classes or elites being 1) the monarchy, which ruled in conjunction with\\n2) the nobility, which controlled the means of production (at the time that\\ncapital was agricultural land), and/or 3) the military. Workers were viewed as part\\nof the means of production and had essentially no say in how the order was run.\\nEven societies that had little or no contact with each other developed in\\nsimilar ways because they had similar situations to deal with and because the\\nnature of their decision making was similar.5 Across countries there always were,\\nand still are, di\\x00erent levels of governance at the country level, the state/province\\nlevel, the municipality level, etc., and there are timeless and universal ways that\\nthey operate and interact with each other that have been pretty consistent across\\nthe world. The monarchs needed people to manage the day-to-day operations\\nfor them. The top people were ministers, who oversaw the bureaucracies of\\npeople who did the various jobs that needed to be done for government to work.\\nWhat exists today is simply the result of the natural evolutions of these timeless\\nand universal ways of interacting, with di\\x00erent countries’ own cultural \\x00avors\\nthrown in. For example, the roles of the ministers who helped the monarchs\\nevolved into the roles of prime ministers and other ministers that now exist in\\nalmost all countries (though in the United States they are called “secretaries”).\\nOver time, these systems have evolved in varied but logical ways as a result of\\nstruggles for wealth and power. For example, in England around 1200 there was\\na wealth and power struggle that evolved gradually at \\x00rst and then abruptly intoa civil war, which is how these shifts tend to evolve, between the nobility and the\\nmonarchy. Like most of these struggles, the \\x00ght was over money and the power\\nto determine who got how much money. The monarchy under King John\\nwanted to get more tax money and the nobles wanted to give less tax money.\\nThey disagreed over how much say the nobles should have on the matter, so they\\nhad a civil war. The nobles won and gained more power to set the rules, which\\nled to what they \\x00rst called a “council,” which soon became the \\x00rst Parliament,\\nwhich evolved into what exists in England today. The peace treaty that\\nformalized this deal into law in 1215 is called the Magna Carta. Like most laws,\\nthis one didn’t matter much relative to power so another civil war broke out in\\nwhich the nobles and the monarchy again fought over wealth and power. In\\n1225 they wrote up a new Magna Carta under Henry III (King John’s son),\\nwhich those with power got to interpret and enforce. A few decades later, the\\n\\x00ghting picked up again. In that war, the nobles cut o\\x00 tax payments to the\\nmonarchy, which forced Henry III to give in to the nobles’ demands. These\\nstruggles went on constantly, leading the orders to evolve.\\nFast forward to the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries and one can see that there\\nwere big changes in the sources of wealth, at \\x00rst because of global exploration\\nand colonialism (starting with the Portuguese and the Spanish) and later because\\nof the invention of capitalism (stocks and bonds) and labor-saving machines that\\nfueled the Industrial Revolutions (particularly helping the Dutch and then the\\nBritish), which made those who pro\\x00ted from these sources of wealth more\\npowerful—i.e., the shifts in wealth and power over these centuries were from a)\\nlandowning nobles (who then had the wealth) and monarchies (who then had\\nthe political power) to b) capitalists (who in the later period had the wealth) and\\nelected representatives or autocratic government leaders (who in the later period\\nhad the political power). Almost all countries made these shifts—some\\npeacefully but most painfully.\\nFor example, in France for most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the king\\nruled in a balance of power arrangement with three other classes: 1) the clergy, 2)\\nthe nobility, and 3) the commoners. There were representatives of these groups\\nwho voted. The \\x00rst two classes, who accounted for only 2 percent of the\\npopulation, had more votes than—or eventually the same number of votes as—the commoners, who made up 98 percent of the population. They called this\\ninternal order based on three classes the ancien régime (which means “old\\norder”). Then practically overnight it changed in a revolutionary way via the\\nFrench Revolution, which began on May 5, 1789, when the third class—the\\ncommoners—had enough of that system, overthrew the others, and took the\\npower for itself. In most countries around the world at the time, the same basic\\nruling order prevailed—i.e., the monarchy and nobles, who accounted for a very\\nsmall percentage of the population and had most of the wealth, ruled until all of\\na sudden there was a civil war/revolution that led the old order to be replaced\\nwith a very di\\x00erent new ruling order.\\nThough the internal orders for managing these class struggles were and are\\ndi\\x00erent in di\\x00erent countries, they evolved similarly across countries. For\\nexample, they evolved both gradually (through reforms) and abruptly (through\\ncivil wars/revolutions) and they evolved into those orders that now exist in all\\ncountries. I expect they will continue to evolve gradually and abruptly to\\nproduce new domestic orders. While the classes who have the wealth and\\npolitical power change, the processes that produce these changes have remained\\npretty much the same through time right up to today. These changes have\\noccurred through struggles that have led to both a) peaceful reforms through\\nnegotiations and b) violent reforms via civil wars and revolutions. The peaceful\\nreforms tend to come earlier in the cycle and the violent civil wars and\\nrevolutionary reforms tend to come later in the cycle for logical reasons that we\\nwill delve into later.\\nI cannot overstate the importance of class struggles relative to individual\\nstruggles. We, especially those of us in the United States, which is thought of as a\\n“melting pot,” tend to focus more on individual struggles and not give adequate\\nattention to class struggles. I didn’t fully realize the importance of class struggles\\nuntil I did my extensive study of history, which led me to this principle:\\n In all countries throughout time (though in varying degr ees) people ﬁnd themselv es\\nwithin “classes” either because they choose to be with people like them or because others\\nstereotype them as part of certain groups.  Power is usually shared among three or\\nfour classes. Who and what people feel most connected with, are around most,\\nand are most like will determine which class or classes they are in; how people areclassed determines who their friends or allies are and who their enemies are.\\nWhile rich and poor and right (i.e., capitalist) and left (i.e., socialist) are the most\\ncommon big class distinctions, there are many other important distinctions,\\nsuch as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, lifestyle (e.g., liberal or conservative), and\\nlocation (e.g., urban versus suburban versus rural). Generally speaking, people\\ntend to cluster in these classes, and when times are good early in the cycle there is\\nmore harmony among these classes and when things are bad there is more\\n\\x00ghting among them.\\nWhile I love that the United States is the country where these class\\ndistinctions matter least, people’s classes still matter in the US and they matter a\\nlot more during stressful times when class con\\x00icts intensify.\\nTo help you get the picture in a more intimate way, let’s do a simple\\nexercise. Assume that most people who don’t know you well look at you\\nas being in a member of one or several classes, because that’s a good\\nassumption. Now, to imagine how you are perceived, look at the\\nfollowing list and ask yourself which classes you fall into. After you\\nanswer that, ask yourself which classes you feel an a\\x00nity for and expect\\nto be your allies. Which classes do you not like or view as your enemies?\\nWhich ones are the ruling classes, and which ones are the revolutionary\\nclasses who want to topple them? Which ones are on the ascent, and\\nwhich ones are on the decline? You might consider writing these down and\\nthinking about them because during periods of greater con\\x00ict the classes you\\nare in or are assumed to be in will become more important in determining who\\nyou will be with and against, what you will do, and where you will end up.\\n1. Rich or poor?\\n2. Right, left, or moderate?\\n3. Race?\\n4. Ethnicity?\\n5. Religion?\\n6. Gender?\\n7. Lifestyle (e.g., liberal or conservative)?\\n8. Location (e.g., urban, suburban, or rural)?Still today only a small percentage of the population, which comes from only\\na few of these classes, has most of the wealth and power and rules as “the elites.”\\nTo me it is clear that the capitalist class now has the most \\x00nancial power in\\nmost countries and political power in democracies lies in the hands of all the\\npeople who choose to vote, while in autocracies it lies in the hands of the limited\\nnumber of people selected by whatever process they have to make selections.6 So,\\nfor the most part today, those are the “ruling classes” and “the elites” who\\noversee the current domestic orders, though they are now under attack, so this is\\nprobably shifting. For example, there is now a big movement in the United\\nStates to be much more inclusive of members of di\\x00erent classes in both the\\ncapitalist money-making world and in the political world. These shifts can be\\ngood or bad depending on whether they are handled peacefully or violently and\\nsmartly or stupidly. One timeless and universal truth that I saw go back as\\nfar as I studied history, since before Confucius who lived around 500\\nBCE, is that \\n those societies that draw on the widest range of people and give them\\nresponsibilities based on their merits rather than privileges are the most sustainably\\nsuccessful because 1) they ﬁnd the best talent to do their jobs well, 2) they have diversity of\\nperspectiv es, and 3) the y are per ceived as the fair est, which fosters social stability .\\nI presume that the current internal orders of countries, like those of the past,\\nwill continue evolving to become something di\\x00erent through the struggles of\\ndi\\x00erent classes with each other over how to divide wealth and political power.\\nBecause this wealth and power dynamic is very important, it is worth watching\\nclosely to discern which classes are gaining and which ones are losing wealth and\\npower (e.g., AI and information technology developers are now evolving to gain\\nit at the expense of those who are being replaced by such technologies) and also\\nto discern the reactions to these shifts that lead the cycles to change.\\nSo, as I see it, everything is changing in classic ways driven by a tried-and-true\\nperpetual-motion machine. This machine has produced, and is producing,\\ndi\\x00erent systems, such as communism, fascism, autocracies, democracies, and\\nevolutionary descendants and hybrids of these, such as “state capitalism” in\\nChina. It will produce new forms of internal orders to divide wealth and allocate\\npolitical power that will a\\x00ect our lives greatly, all based on how people chooseto be with each other and how human nature enters into how they make their\\nchoices.\\n18. The Political Left/Right Cycle. Capitalists (i.e., those of the right) and\\nsocialists (i.e., those of the left) don’t just have di\\x00erent self-interests—they have\\ndi\\x00erent deep-seated ideological beliefs that they are willing to \\x00ght for. The\\ntypical perspective of the rightist/capitalist is that self-su\\x00ciency, hard work,\\nproductivity, limited government interference, allowing people to keep what\\nthey make, and individual choice are morally good and good for society. They\\nalso believe that the private sector works better than the public sector, that\\ncapitalism works best for most people, and that self-made billionaires are the\\nbiggest contributors to society. Capitalists are typically driven crazy by \\x00nancial\\nsupports for people who lack productivity and pro\\x00tability. To them, making\\nmoney = being productive = getting what one deserves. They don’t pay much\\nattention to whether the economic machine is producing opportunity and\\nprosperity for most people. They can also overlook the fact that their form of\\npro\\x00t making is suboptimal when it comes to achieving the goals of most\\npeople. For example, in a purely capitalist system, the provision of excellent\\npublic education—which is clearly a leading cause of higher productivity and\\ngreater wealth across a society—is not a high priority.\\nThe typical perspective of the leftist/socialist is that helping each other,\\nhaving the government support people, and sharing wealth and opportunity are\\nmorally good and good for society. They believe that the private sector is by and\\nlarge run by capitalists who are greedy, while common workers, such as teachers,\\n\\x00re\\x00ghters, and laborers, contribute more to society. Socialists and communists\\ntend to focus on dividing the pie well and typically aren’t very good at increasing\\nits size. They favor more government intervention, believing those in\\ngovernment will be fairer than capitalists, who are simply trying to exploit\\npeople to make more money.\\nI’ve had exposure to all kinds of economic systems all over the world and have\\nseen why \\n the ability to mak e mone y, save it, and put it into capital (i.e., capitalism) is an\\neffectiv e motiv ator of people and allocat or of resour ces that raises people ’s living\\nstandar ds. But capitalism is also a source of wealth and oppor tunity gaps that are unfair ,can be counterpr oductiv e, are highly cyclical, and can be destabilizing. In my opinion, the\\ngreatest challenge for policy mak ers is to engineer a capitalist economic syste m that raises\\nproductivity and living standar ds without worsening inequities and instabilities.\\n21. The Big Balance of Power Cycle That Drives the Big Peace/War Cycle\\nBoth Within Countries and Between Countries. In studying a lot of history\\nand experiencing a tiny sliver of it myself I have seen how the balance of power\\ndynamic drives virtually all struggles for power—e.g., o\\x00ce politics within\\norganizations, local and national politics in shaping the domestic order, and\\ninternational politics in shaping the world order. It applies equally well to\\ndetermining the formations and changes in world orders as in domestic orders.\\nThe dynamic transpires in a series of steps explained here, though how exactly it\\nunfolds depends on the order and people at the time these stages unfold:\\nStep 1: The formation of alliances. When there isn’t roughly equal power\\n(e.g., if in the US the Democrats have much more power than the Republicans\\nor vice versa), the more powerful party will take advantage of and control the less\\npowerful party. To neutralize the stronger party, the weaker party naturally \\x00nds\\nother parties to join it in opposing the stronger party so collectively they can\\nhave the same or more power as the opposition. The weaker party does this by\\ngiving the other parties what they want in return for their support. If the\\nformerly weaker party collectively gains more power than the formerly stronger\\nparty from doing this, the formerly stronger party cuts deals with other parties\\nto ally with them to eliminate the superiority of the opposition. As a result, allies\\nwho have very di\\x00erent vested interests unite in opposing the common enemy—\\nas the saying goes, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” This dynamic\\nnaturally leads to the di\\x00erent sides having roughly equal amounts of power and\\nsplits within themselves. Sometimes the di\\x00erences within the parties are so great\\nthat some segments want to destroy the other segments in order to gain control\\nof their party. This alliance- and enemy-forming dynamic happens at all di\\x00erent\\nlevels of relationships, from the most important international alliances that\\nde\\x00ne the most important elements of the world order down to the mostimportant alliances within countries that de\\x00ne the internal orders, down to\\nthose within states, within cities, within organizations, and among individuals.\\nThe most important evolutionary shift to a\\x00ect these has been the shrinking of\\nthe world to make allies and enemies more global. In the old days they were less\\nglobal (e.g., European countries formed alliances to \\x00ght other European\\ncountries, Asian countries did the same in Asia, etc.), but as the world has\\nshrunk because of improved transportation and communications it has become\\nmore interconnected and bigger and more global alliances have developed. That\\nis why there were two big sides in World Wars I and II and likely will be going\\nforward.\\nStep 2: War to determine the winners and losers. Big \\x00ghts typically\\nhappen when both sides have roughly equal powers and existential di\\x00erences\\nexist between them. Big \\x00ghts typically don’t occur when there are big\\nasymmetries in power because it would be stupid for obviously weaker entities to\\n\\x00ght obviously stronger ones, and if they did \\x00ght, the \\x00ghts would be small in\\nscale. However, sometimes when there are roughly equal levels of power on both\\nsides, stalemates and gridlocks rather than big \\x00ghts can occur when the\\nexistential threat of harming oneself in the process of trying to beat the other\\nside is greater than the gains that would come from having a \\x00ght to the death.\\nFor example, when there is mutually assured destruction—e.g., as the US and\\nthe Soviet Union faced—there is more likely to be a stand-o\\x00 than a \\x00ght.\\nWhile these big \\x00ghts are typically violent, they can be nonviolent if the\\nentities have nonviolent rules of engagement that they adhere to that allow the\\nresolution of disputes, most importantly the existential ones. For example, in the\\n2020 US election, the two political parties had roughly equal amounts of power\\nand irreconcilable di\\x00erences so that they had a big \\x00ght for political control.\\nThat led to the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, but eventually\\nthe peaceful transfer of political power as set out in the Constitution prevailed.\\nHistory has shown that, when there are not clear rules and/or when the parties\\ndon’t abide by them, the \\x00ghting will be far more brutal, often to the death.Step 3: Fighting among the winners. History shows us that after the \\x00ght\\nfor power in which the common enemy is defeated, those who united against the\\ncommon enemy typically \\x00ght among themselves for power and those in the\\nlosing party do the same as they plan their next attack. I call this the “purge”\\nstate of the balance of power dynamic. It has happened in all cases, with the\\nReign of Terror in France and the Red Terror in the Soviet Union being the\\nmost well-known. This same sort of \\x00ghting has happened between countries, as\\nwith the US and the Soviet Union, who were allies in World War II. Similarly,\\nthe united front of Chinese communists and nationalists that fought the\\nJapanese in the war immediately battled each other for power when the war was\\nover. Understanding this typical dynamic, one should look out for internal\\n\\x00ghting among the winners right after the big war is over. We should always\\nwatch whether the factions within the same parties are inclined to \\x00ght each\\nother for control of their parties. When new regimes (i.e., the winning parties)\\ncome to power watch what they do with the enemies they defeated. What\\nhappens next depends on the system and the leaders in the system. In the US and\\ngenerally in democracies, the rules allow the losers to remain unharmed and\\nunconstrained, which allows them to try to regain power and \\x00ght again. In\\nharsh autocracies, the losers are eliminated one way or another.\\nStep 4: Peace and prosperity occur but eventually lead to excesses\\nre\\x00ected in large wealth and opportunity gaps and overindebtedness.\\nHistory shows us that because of this dynamic the best of times—i.e., when\\nthere is peace and prosperity—typically happens after a war, when the leadership\\nand power structure are clearly established so there isn’t big \\x00ghting for power\\nwithin the country or with other countries—because there is an obviously more\\npowerful entity that enables the less powerful entities to have a good life.\\nStep 5: Increasing con\\x00ict leads to revolutionary changes in domestic\\nand world orders. For as long as there is peace and prosperity for the majority\\nof the people, which will only be the case if the system is fair and the majority of\\nthe people remain self-disciplined and productive, peace and prosperity are likelyto continue. However, as previously discussed, periods of peace and prosperity\\nalso tend to encourage big wealth gaps and debt bubbles that lead to con\\x00icts\\nwhen prosperity fades and there are other things to \\x00ght over.\\nThis cycle tracks the internal and external order and disorder cycles that we will\\nexplore in Chapters 5 and 6.\\n1 The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 created countries—i.e., sovereign states—as we now know them.\\n2 Japan from 1971 to 1990 is an exception with regards to the military.\\n3 Germany in World War I and the UK in World War II are classic examples.\\n4 For example, in the last century, the wealth share of the top 1 percent in the US ranged from close to 50\\npercent in the 1920s to a bit over 20 percent in the late 1970s; in the UK, it ranged from over 70 percent in\\n1900 to around 15 percent in the 1980s and is currently around 35 percent (\\x00gures from World Inequality\\nDatabase). These shifts in inequality can be seen at least as far back as the Roman Republic, as Walter\\nScheidel describes in The Great Leveler.\\n5 For example, for much of history Europe, China, and most countries had monarchs and nobles as the\\nruling classes, yet they were a bit di\\x00erent. In Europe, the church was also part of the ruling mix. In Japan,\\nthe monarchy (the emperor and his ministers), the military, and the business community (the merchants\\nand artisans) were the ruling elites.\\n6 That doesn’t mean that those who run autocracies don’t ultimately report to the people because the\\npeople could overthrow the government.CHAPTER 3\\nTHE BIG CYCLE OF MONEY, CREDIT,\\nDEBT, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY\\nWhat most people and their countries want most is wealth and power,\\nand money and credit are the biggest in\\x00uences on how wealth and\\npower rise and decline. If you don’t understand how money and credit\\nwork, you can’t understand how the system works, and if you don’t\\nunderstand how the system works, you can’t understand what’s coming\\nat you.\\nFor example, if you don’t understand how the Roaring ’20s led to a debt\\nbubble and a big wealth gap, how the bursting of that debt bubble led to the\\n1930–33 Great Depression, and how the depression led to con\\x00icts over wealth\\nall over the world, you won’t understand why Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected\\npresident in 1932. You also won’t understand why, soon after his inauguration,\\nhe announced a new plan in which the central government and the Federal\\nReserve would together provide a lot of money and credit, a change that was\\nsimilar to what was happening in other countries at the time and that is similar\\nto what is happening today in response to the pandemic-caused crisis. Unless\\nyou understand how money and credit work, you can’t understand why the\\nworld changed as it did in 1933 or what happened next (World War II), how the\\nwar was won and lost, and why the new world order was created as it was in\\n1945. But when you can recognize the underlying mechanics that drove all of\\nthose things in the past, you can also understand what is happening now and\\nhave a much better sense about what is likely to happen in the future.In speaking with several of the world’s most renowned historians and\\npolitical practitioners, including current and former heads of state, foreign\\nministers, \\x00nance ministers, and central bankers, we recognized that we each\\nheld di\\x00erent pieces of the puzzle to explain how the world works. I had been\\nlacking an adequate practical understanding of the workings of politics and\\ngeopolitics, and they lacked an adequate practical understanding of the way that\\nmoney and credit work. Several told me that understanding money and credit in\\nthis way has been the biggest missing piece in their quest to understand the\\nlessons of history, and I explained to them that their perspectives helped me\\nunderstand the political dynamics that a\\x00ect policy choices. This chapter is\\nfocused on the money, credit, and economic piece.\\nLet’s start with money and credit.\\nTHE TIMELESS AND UNIVERSAL\\nFUNDAMENTALS OF MONEY AND CREDIT\\n All entities—people , companies, nonpr oﬁt organizations, and governments—deal with the\\nsame basic ﬁnanci al realities, and always have. They have money that comes in\\n(i.e., revenue) and money that goes out (i.e., expenses) that, when netted,\\nmake up their net income. These \\x00ows are measured in numbers that\\nappear in income statements. If an entity brings in more than it spends,\\nit has a pro\\x00t that causes its savings to go up. If it spends more than it\\nearns, its savings go down, or it makes up the di\\x00erence by borrowing or\\ntaking money from someone else. If an entity has many more assets than\\nliabilities (i.e., a large net worth), it can spend above its income by selling\\nassets until the money runs out, at which point it has to slash its\\nexpenses. If it doesn’t have much more in assets than it has in liabilities\\nand its income falls beneath the amount it needs to pay out to cover the\\ntotal of its operating expenses and its debt-service expenses, it will have\\nto cut its expenses or will default or restructure its debts.All of an entity’s assets and liabilities (i.e., debts) can be shown in its balance\\nsheet. Whether it writes those numbers down or not, every country, company,\\nnonpro\\x00t organization, and individual has them. When economists, for\\nexample, combine each entity’s income, expenses, and savings, they get all\\nentities’ incomes, expenses, and savings. \\n The way entities collectiv ely handle their\\nﬁnances as reﬂected in their income statements and balance sheets is the biggest driver of\\nchanges in internal and world orders.  If you can take your understanding of your\\nown income, expenses, and savings, imagine how that applies to others,\\nand put them together, you will see how the whole thing works.\\nTake a moment to think about your own \\x00nancial situation. How much\\nincome do you have now relative to your expenses and how much will you have\\nin the future? How much savings do you have and what are those savings\\ninvested in? Now play things out. If your income fell or disappeared, how long\\nwould your savings last? How much risk do you have in the value of your\\ninvestments and savings? If that value fell by half, how would you be \\x00nancially?\\nCan you easily sell your assets to get cash to pay your expenses or service your\\ndebts? What are your other sources of money, from the government or from\\nelsewhere? These are the most important calculations you can make to ensure\\nyour economic well-being. Now look at others—other people, businesses,\\nnonpro\\x00t organizations, and governments—realizing that the same is true for\\nthem. See how we are interconnected and what changes in conditions might\\nmean for you and others who might a\\x00ect you. Since the economy is the sum of\\nthese entities operating in this way, it will help you understand what is\\nhappening and what is likely to happen.\\nFor example, since one entity’s spending is another’s income, when one\\nentity cuts its expenses, that will hurt not just that entity, but it will also\\nhurt others who depend on that spending to earn income. Similarly,\\nsince one entity’s debts are another’s assets, an entity that defaults\\nreduces other entities’ assets, which requires them to cut their spending.\\nThis dynamic produces a self-reinforcing downward debt and economic\\ncontraction that becomes a political issue as people argue over how to\\ndivide the shrunken pie.As a principle, \\n debt eats equity . What I mean by that is that debts have to\\nbe paid above all else. For example, if you own a house (i.e., you have\\n“equity” ownership) and you can’t make the mortgage payments, the\\nhouse will be sold or taken away. In other words, the creditor will get\\npaid ahead of the owner of the house. As a result, when your income is\\nless than your expenses and your assets are less than your liabilities (i.e.,\\ndebts), you are on the way to having to sell your assets.\\nUnlike what most people intuitively think, there isn’t a \\x00xed amount of\\nmoney and credit in existence. Money and credit can easily be created by\\ncentral banks. People, companies, nonpro\\x00t organizations, and\\ngovernments like it when central banks make a lot of money and credit\\nbecause it gives them more spending power. When the money and credit\\nare spent, it makes most goods, services, and investment assets go up in\\nprice. It also creates debt that has to be repaid, which requires people,\\ncompanies, nonpro\\x00t organizations, and governments to eventually\\nspend less than they earn, which is di\\x00cult and painful. That is why\\nmoney, credit, debt, and economic activity are inherently cyclical. In the\\ncredit-creation phase, demand for goods, services, and investment assets\\nand the production of them are both strong, and in the debt-repayment\\nphase, both are weak.\\nBut what if the debts never had to be paid back? Then there would be\\nno debt squeeze and no painful paying back period. But that would be terrible\\nfor those who lent because they’d lose their money, right? Let’s think for a\\nmoment to see if we can \\x00nd a way of resolving debt issues without harming\\neither borrowers or lenders.\\nSince governments have the ability to both make and borrow money, why\\ncouldn’t the central bank lend money at an interest rate of about 0 percent to\\nthe central government to distribute as it likes to support the economy?\\nCouldn’t it also lend to others at low rates and allow those debtors to never pay\\nit back? Normally debtors have to pay back the original amount borrowed\\n(principal) plus interest in installments over a period of time. But the central\\nbank has the power to set the interest rate at 0 percent and keep rolling over the\\ndebt so that the debtor never has to pay it back. That would be the equivalent ofgiving the debtors the money, but it wouldn’t look that way because the debt\\nwould still be accounted for as an asset that the central bank owns, so the central\\nbank could still say it is performing its normal lending functions. This is the\\nexact thing that happened in the wake of the economic crisis caused by\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Many versions of this have happened many\\ntimes in history. Who pays? It is bad for those outside the central bank\\nwho still hold the debts as assets—cash and bonds—who won’t get\\nreturns that would preserve their purchasing power.\\nThe biggest problem that we now collectively face is that for many\\npeople, companies, nonpro\\x00t organizations, and governments, their\\nincomes are low in relation to their expenses, and their debts and other\\nliabilities (such as those for pensions, healthcare, and insurance) are very\\nlarge relative to the value of their assets. It may not seem that way—in fact,\\nit often seems the opposite—because there are many people, companies,\\nnonpro\\x00t organizations, and governments that look rich even while they are in\\nthe process of going broke. They look rich because they spend a lot, have plenty\\nof assets, and even have plenty of cash. However, if you look carefully, you will\\nbe able to identify those that look rich but are in \\x00nancial trouble because they\\nhave incomes that are below their expenses and/or liabilities that are greater than\\ntheir assets, so if you project what will likely happen to their \\x00nances in the\\nfuture, you will see that they will have to cut their expenses and sell their assets in\\npainful ways that will leave them broke. We each need to do those projections of\\nwhat the future will look like for our own \\x00nances, for others who are relevant\\nto us, and for the world economy. In a nutshell, for some people, companies,\\nnonpro\\x00t organizations, and countries, the liabilities are enormous relative\\nto the net incomes and the asset values that are required to meet those\\nobligations, so they are \\x00nancially weak, but they don’t look that way\\nbecause they spend a lot \\x00nanced by borrowing.\\nIf anything I’ve written here is confusing to you, I urge you to take a moment\\nto try to apply it to your own circumstances. Pencil out what your \\x00nancial\\nsafety margin looks like (how long will you be \\x00nancially OK if the worst-case\\nscenario happens—e.g., you lose your job and your investment assets fall to be\\nonly half as much to account for possible price falls, taxes, and in\\x00ation). Thendo that calculation for others, add them up, and then you will have a good\\npicture of the state of your world. I’ve done that with the help of my partners at\\nBridgewater and \\x00nd it invaluable in imagining what is likely to happen.1\\nIn summary, these basic \\x00nancial realities work for all people,\\ncompanies, nonpro\\x00t organizations, and governments in the same way\\nthey work for you and me, with the one big, important exception I\\nmentioned earlier. All countries can create money and credit out of the\\nair to give to people to spend or lend out. By producing money and giving it\\nto debtors in need, central banks can prevent the debt crisis dynamic that I just\\nexplained. For that reason I will modify the prior principle to say: \\n debt eats\\nequity but centr al banks can feed debt by printing mone y instead.  It should be no\\nsurprise that governments print money when debt crises cause politically\\nunacceptable amounts of equity-eating debt and corresponding economic pain.\\nHowever, not all money that governments print is of equal value.\\nThe monies (i.e., currencies) that are widely accepted around the\\nworld are called reserve currencies. At the time of my writing this, the\\nworld’s dominant reserve currency is the US dollar, which is created by the US\\ncentral bank, the Federal Reserve. A much less important reserve currency is the\\neuro, which is produced by the Eurozone countries’ central bank, the European\\nCentral Bank. The Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, and the British pound\\nare relatively small reserve currencies now, though the renminbi is quickly\\ngrowing in importance.\\n Having a reser ve currency is great while it lasts because it gives a countr y exceptional\\nborrowing and spending power and signiﬁcant power over who else in the world gets the\\nmone y and credit needed to buy and sell internationally . However, having a reserve\\ncurrency typically sows the seeds of a country ceasing to be a reserve currency\\ncountry. That is because it allows the country to borrow more than it could\\notherwise a\\x00ord to borrow, and the creation of lots of money and credit to\\nservice the debt debases the value of the currency and causes the loss of its status\\nas a reserve currency. The loss of its reserve currency status is a terrible thing\\nbecause \\n having a reser ve currency is one of the greatest powers a countr y can have\\nbecause it giv es the countr y enormous buying power and geopolitical power .In contrast, non-reserve currency countries often \\x00nd themselves in need of\\nmoney in a reserve currency (e.g., dollars) when they have a lot of debt\\ndenominated in that currency, which they can’t print, or they don’t have much\\nsavings in that currency and their ability to earn the currency they need falls o\\x00.\\nWhen countries desperately need reserve currencies to service their\\nreserve currency-denominated debts, and to buy things from sellers who\\nonly accept reserve currencies, they can go bankrupt. This has happened\\noften in the past and it is where things now stand for a number of countries. It is\\nalso where things stand for local governments and states and for many of us.\\nThis con\\x00guration of circumstances has been handled in the same way, so it’s\\neasy to see how this machine works—and that is what I will show you in this\\nchapter.\\nLet’s start with the basics and build from there.\\nWHAT IS MONEY?\\nMoney is a medium of exchange that can also be used as a storehold of\\nwealth.\\nBy “medium of exchange,” I mean something that can be given to others to\\nbuy things. Basically, people produce things in order to exchange them with\\npeople who have other things they want. Because carrying around non-money\\nobjects in the hope of exchanging them for what one wants (i.e., bartering) is\\nine\\x00cient, virtually every society that has ever existed has created a form of\\nmoney (i.e., currency), which is something portable that everyone agrees is of\\nvalue so it can be exchanged for what they want.\\nBy a “storehold of wealth,” I mean a vehicle for storing buying power\\nbetween acquiring it and spending it. While one of the most logical things to\\nstore wealth in is a claim on money that can be used later, people also store their\\nwealth in assets that they expect will retain their value or appreciate (such as\\ngold, silver, gems, paintings, real estate, stocks, and bonds). By holding on to\\nsomething that appreciates, they \\x00gure that they can do a bit better than justholding on to the currency—and, when needed, can always exchange the thing\\nthey’re holding to get the currency to buy the things they want to buy. This is\\nwhere credit and debt come into the picture. It is important to understand the\\ndi\\x00erence between money and debt. Money is what settles claims—you pay your\\nbills and are done. Debt is a promise to deliver money.\\nWhen lenders lend, for example, they assume the money plus the interest\\nthey receive back will buy more goods and services than if they had simply held\\non to the money. When all goes well, the borrowers use the money productively\\nand earn a pro\\x00t with it themselves, so they can pay the lenders back and still\\nhave money left over. While the loan is outstanding, it is an asset for the lender\\n(e.g., a bond) and a liability (i.e., debt) for the borrower. When the money is paid\\nback, the assets and liabilities disappear, and both the borrower and lender are\\nbetter o\\x00, having essentially split the pro\\x00ts that came from the productive\\nlending. Such lending is also good for society, which bene\\x00ts from the resulting\\nproductivity gains.2\\nIt’s important to realize that most money and credit (especially the\\ngovernment-issued money that now exists) have no intrinsic value. They\\nare just journal entries in an accounting system that can easily be\\nchanged. The purpose of that system is to help allocate resources\\ne\\x00ciently so that productivity can grow, rewarding both lenders and\\nborrowers, but the system periodically breaks down. When that happens\\n(as it always has, since the beginning of time), the currency supply is\\n“monetized”3 and currency values fall or are destroyed, and wealth shifts in a big\\nway, sending shockwaves through the economy and markets.\\nWhat all this means is that the debt and credit machine doesn’t work\\nperfectly. Supplies, demands, and values of money cycle up and down. The\\nupswings produce joyful abundance. The downswings produce painful\\nrestructurings.\\nLet’s now get into how these cycles work, building from the fundamentals up\\nto where we are now.MONEY, CREDIT, AND WEALTH\\nWhile money and credit are associated with wealth, they aren’t the same\\nthing as wealth. Because money and credit can buy wealth (i.e., goods and\\nservices), the amount of money and credit you have and the amount of\\nwealth you have look pretty much the same. But you cannot create more\\nwealth simply by creating more money and credit. To create more wealth,\\nyou have to be more productive. The relationship between the creation of\\nmoney and credit and the creation of wealth is often confused, yet it is\\nthe biggest driver of economic cycles. Let’s look at it more closely.\\nThere is typically a mutually reinforcing relationship between the creation of\\nmoney and credit and the creation of goods, services, and investment assets that\\nare produced, which is why they’re often confused as being the same thing.\\nThink of it this way: there is both a \\x00nancial economy and a real\\neconomy. Though they are related, they are di\\x00erent. Each has its own\\nsupply-and-demand factors that drive it. In the real economy, supply and\\ndemand are driven by the amount of goods and services produced and the\\nnumber of buyers who want them. When the level of goods and services\\ndemanded is strong and rising and there is not enough capacity to produce the\\nthings demanded, the real economy’s capacity to grow is limited. If demand\\nkeeps rising faster than the capacity to produce, prices go up and in\\x00ation rises.\\nThat’s where the \\x00nancial economy comes in. Facing in\\x00ation, central banks\\nnormally tighten money and credit to slow demand in the real economy; when\\nthere is too little demand, they do the opposite by providing money and credit\\nto stimulate demand. By raising and lowering supplies of money and\\ncredit, central banks are able to raise and lower the demand and\\nproduction of \\x00nancial assets, goods, and services. But they’re unable to do\\nthis perfectly, so we have the short-term debt cycle, which we experience as\\nalternating periods of growth and recession.\\nThen of course there is the value of money and credit to consider, which is\\nbased on its own supply and demand. When a lot of a currency is created relative\\nto the demand for it, it declines in value. Where the money and credit \\x00ow isimportant to determining what happens. For example, when they no longer go\\ninto lending that fuels increases in economic demand and instead go into other\\ncurrencies and in\\x00ation-hedge assets, they fail to stimulate economic activity and\\ninstead cause the value of the currency to decline and the value of in\\x00ation-\\nhedge assets to rise. At such times high in\\x00ation can occur because the supply of\\nmoney and credit has increased relative to the demand for it, which we call\\n“monetary in\\x00ation.” That can happen at the same time as there is weak demand\\nfor goods and services and the selling of assets so that the real economy is\\nexperiencing de\\x00ation. That is how in\\x00ationary depressions come about. For\\nthese reasons we have to watch movements in the supplies and demands of\\nboth the real economy and the \\x00nancial economy to understand what is\\nlikely to happen \\x00nancially and economically.\\nFor example, how \\x00nancial assets are produced by the government through\\n\\x00scal and monetary policy has a huge e\\x00ect on who gets the buying power that\\ngoes along with them, which also determines what the buying power is spent on.\\nNormally money and credit are created by central banks and \\x00ow into \\x00nancial\\nassets, which the private credit system uses to \\x00nance people’s borrowing and\\nspending. But in moments of crisis, governments can choose where to direct\\nmoney, credit, and buying power rather than it being allocated by the\\nmarketplace, and capitalism as we know it is suspended. This is what happened\\nworldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nRelated to this confusion between the \\x00nancial economy and the real\\neconomy is the relationship between the prices of things and the value of\\nthings. Because they tend to go together, they can be confused as being\\nthe same thing. They tend to go together because when people have more\\nmoney and credit, they are more inclined to spend more and can spend\\nmore. To the extent that spending increases economic production and\\nraises the prices of goods, services, and \\x00nancial assets, it can be said to\\nincrease wealth because the people who already own those assets become\\n“richer” when measured by the way we account for wealth. However, that\\nincrease in wealth is more an illusion than a reality for two reasons: 1)\\nthe increased credit that pushes prices and production up has to be paid\\nback, which, all things being equal, will have the opposite e\\x00ect when thebill comes due and 2) the intrinsic value of a thing doesn’t increase just\\nbecause its price goes up.\\nThink about it this way: if you own a house and the government\\ncreates a lot of money and credit, there might be many eager buyers who\\nwould push the price of your house up. But it’s still the same house; your\\nactual wealth hasn’t increased, just your calculated wealth. It’s the same\\nwith any other investment asset you own that goes up in price when the\\ngovernment creates money—stocks, bonds, etc. The amount of calculated\\nwealth goes up but the amount of actual wealth hasn’t gone up because you own\\nthe exact same thing you did before it was considered to be worth more. In other\\nwords, using the market values of what one owns to measure one’s wealth gives\\nan illusion of changes in wealth that don’t really exist. As far as understanding\\nhow the economic machine works, the important thing to understand is that\\nmoney and credit are stimulative when they’re given out and depressing\\nwhen they have to be paid back. That’s what normally makes money,\\ncredit, and economic growth so cyclical.\\nThe central bankers who control money and credit (i.e., central banks)\\nvary the costs and availability of money and credit to control markets\\nand the economy. When the economy is growing too quickly and they want to\\nslow it down, central bankers make less money and credit available, causing both\\nto become more expensive. This encourages people to lend rather than borrow\\nand spend. When there is too little growth and central bankers want to stimulate\\nthe economy, they make money and credit cheap and plentiful, which\\nencourages people to borrow and invest and/or spend. These variations in the\\ncost and availability of money and credit also cause the prices and quantities of\\ngoods, services, and investment assets to rise and fall. But banks can only control\\nthe economy within their capacities to produce money and credit growth, and\\ntheir capacities to do that are limited.\\nThink of the central bank as having a bottle of stimulant it can inject\\ninto the economy as needed. When the markets and the economy sag, it\\ndelivers shots of the money and credit stimulant to pick them up. When\\nthe markets and economy are too strong, it gives them less or no\\nstimulant. These moves lead to cyclical rises and declines in the amountsand prices of money and credit, and of goods, services, and \\x00nancial\\nassets. These moves typically come in the form of short-term debt cycles\\nand long-term debt cycles. The short-term debt cycles of ups and downs\\ntypically last about eight years, give or take a few. The timing is determined\\nby how long it takes the stimulant to raise demand to the point that it reaches\\nthe limits of the real economy’s capacity to produce. Most people have seen\\nenough of these short-term debt cycles—popularly known as “the business\\ncycle”—to know what they are like, to such an extent that they mistakenly think\\nthey will go on working this way forever. I distinguish them from the long-\\nterm debt cycle, which typically plays out over 50 to 75 years (and so\\ncontains about six to 10 short-term debt cycles).4 Because the crises that\\noccur as these long-term debt cycles play out happen only once in a\\nlifetime, most people don’t expect them. As a result they typically take\\npeople by surprise and do a lot of harm. The long-term debt cycle that is now\\nin the late-cycle phase was designed in 1944 in Bretton Woods, New\\nHampshire, and began in 1945, when World War II ended and the\\ndollar/US-dominated world order began.\\nThese long-term debt cycles are driven by the amount of stimulant left in the\\ncentral bank’s bottle. They start after previously existing excess debts have been\\nrestructured and central banks have a full bottle of stimulant. They end when\\ndebts are high and the bottle of stimulant is nearly empty or, more speci\\x00cally,\\nwhen the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit\\ngrowth that passes through the economic system to produce real\\neconomic growth. Throughout history, central governments and central\\nbanks have created money and credit, which weakened their own\\ncurrencies and raised their levels of monetary in\\x00ation to o\\x00set the\\nde\\x00ation that comes from de\\x00ationary credit and economic contractions.\\nThis typically happens when debt levels are high, interest rates can’t be\\nadequately lowered, and the creation of money and credit increases\\n\\x00nancial asset prices more than it increases actual economic activity. At\\nsuch times those who are holding the debt (which is someone else’s\\npromise to give them currency) typically want to exchange the debt they\\nare holding for other storeholds of wealth. Once it is widely perceivedthat money and debt assets are no longer good storeholds of wealth, the\\nlong-term debt cycle is at its end, and a restructuring of the monetary\\nsystem has to occur.\\nSince these cycles are big deals and have happened virtually everywhere for all\\nof recorded history, we need to understand them and have timeless and universal\\nprinciples for dealing with them well. But most people, including many\\neconomists, don’t even acknowledge their existence. That’s because to get a\\nsample size of observations that is large and diverse enough to give one a good\\nunderstanding, one has to have studied them over many hundreds of years in\\nmany di\\x00erent countries. In Part II we will do just that, examining the most\\nimportant of these cycles across history and around the world, with reference to\\nthe timeless and universal mechanics of why money and credit work and fail to\\nwork as mediums of exchange and storeholds of wealth. In this chapter, I will\\nsynthesize all those cases so I can show you how they work archetypically.\\nI will begin with the basics of the long-term debt cycle from way back when\\nand bring you up to the present, giving you the classic template. To be clear, I’m\\nnot saying that all cases transpire exactly like this one, but I am saying that they\\nalmost all follow this pattern closely.\\nTHE LONG-TERM DEBT CYCLE\\nThe long-term debt cycle transpires in six stages:\\nStage 1: It begins with a) little or no debt and b) money being “hard.”\\nThe debt burdens from the last cycle were largely wiped out by restructuring\\nand debt monetization, and because of the consequences of these, particularly\\nin\\x00ation, there is a return to hard money like gold and silver (and sometimes\\ncopper and other metals like nickel) or sometimes a link to a hard currency. For\\nexample, after the destruction of debt and money in Germany’s Weimar\\nRepublic money became backed by gold-denominated assets and land andpegged to the dollar, and after its destruction in Argentina in the late 1980s\\nmoney became linked to the dollar.\\nAt this stage, money being “hard” is important because no trust—or credit—\\nis required to carry out an exchange. Any transaction can be settled on the spot,\\neven if the buyer and seller are strangers or enemies. There is an old saying that\\n“gold is the only \\x00nancial asset that isn’t someone else’s liability.” When you\\nreceive gold coins from a buyer, you can melt them down and exchange the\\nmetal and still receive almost the same value as if you had spent them, unlike a\\ndebt asset like paper money, which is a promise to deliver value (which isn’t\\nmuch of a promise, given how easy it is to print). When countries are at war and\\nthere is no trust in their intentions or abilities to pay, they can still pay in gold.\\nSo gold (and, to a lesser extent, silver) can be used as both a safe medium of\\nexchange and a safe storehold of wealth.\\nStage 2: Then come claims on hard money (i.e., notes or paper money).\\nBecause carrying a lot of metal money around is risky and inconvenient and\\ncreating credit is attractive to both lenders and borrowers, credible parties arise\\nthat put the hard money in a safe place and issue paper claims on it. These\\nparties came to be known as “banks,” though they initially included all sorts of\\ninstitutions that people trusted, such as temples in China. Soon people treat\\nthese paper “claims on money” as if they are money itself. After all, they\\ncan be redeemed for tangible money or used to buy things directly. This type of\\ncurrency system is called a “linked currency system” because the value of the\\ncurrency is linked to the value of something, typically “hard money,” such as\\ngold and silver.\\nStage 3: Then comes increased debt.\\nAt \\x00rst there are the same number of claims on the “hard money” as\\nthere is hard money in the bank. Then the holders of paper claims and\\nthe banks discover the wonders of credit and debt. Holders of paper claims\\nloan them to banks in exchange for interest payments. The banks like to do that\\nbecause they can lend the money to others who can pay a higher interest rate,allowing the banks to make a pro\\x00t. Those who borrow from the bank like it\\nbecause it gives them buying power they didn’t previously have. And the whole\\nsociety likes it because it leads asset prices and production to rise. Since everyone\\nis happy with how things are going, they do a lot of it. More lending and\\nborrowing happens over and over again many times, there is a boom, and the\\nquantity of the claims on the money (i.e., debt assets) rises relative to the amount\\nof actual goods and services there are to buy. Eventually the claims become\\nmuch larger than the actual hard money in the bank.\\nTrouble approaches when there isn’t enough income to service one’s\\ndebts, or when the amount of claims people are holding in the\\nexpectation that they can sell them to get money to buy goods and\\nservices increases faster than the amount of goods and services by an\\namount that makes the conversion from that debt asset (e.g., a bond)\\nimpossible. These two problems tend to come together.\\nConcerning the \\x00rst of these problems, think of debt as negative earnings and\\na negative asset that eats up earnings (because earnings have to go to pay it) and\\neats up other assets (because other assets have to be sold to get the money to pay\\nthe debt). It is senior—meaning it gets paid before any other type of asset—so\\nwhen incomes and the values of assets fall, there is a need to cut expenditures\\nand sell o\\x00 assets to raise the needed cash. When that’s not enough, there needs\\nto be a) debt restructurings (in which debts and debt burdens are reduced,\\nwhich is problematic for both the debtor and the creditor because one person’s\\ndebts are another’s assets) and/or b) the central bank printing money paired with\\nthe central government handing out money and credit to \\x00ll in the holes in\\nincomes and balance sheets (which is what is happening now).\\nStage 4: Then debt crises, defaults, and devaluations come, which leads to\\nthe printing of money and the breaking of the link to hard money.\\nAs for the second problem, this happens when holders of debt don’t believe\\nthey are going to get adequate returns from it relative to other storeholds of\\nwealth and the costs of goods and services. Debt assets (e.g., bonds) are held by\\ninvestors who believe they are storeholds of wealth that can be sold to get money,\\nwhich can be used to buy things. When holders of debt assets try to make theconversion to real money and real goods and services and \\x00nd out that they\\ncan’t, a “run” occurs, by which I mean that lots of holders of that debt try to\\nmake the conversion to money, goods, services, and other \\x00nancial assets. The\\nbank, regardless of whether it is a private bank or a central bank, is then faced\\nwith the choice of allowing that \\x00ow of money out of the debt asset, which will\\nraise interest rates and cause the debt and economic problems to worsen, or of\\nprinting money, in the form of issuing bonds and buying enough of the bonds\\nto prevent interest rates from rising and hopefully reverse the run out of them.\\nInevitably the central bank breaks the link, prints the money, and devalues it\\nbecause not doing that causes an intolerable de\\x00ationary depression. The key at\\nthis stage is to create enough money and devaluation to o\\x00set the de\\x00ationary\\ndepression but not so much as to produce an in\\x00ationary spiral. When this is\\ndone well, I call it a “beautiful deleveraging,” which I describe more completely\\nin my book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises. Sometimes that buying\\nworks temporarily; however, if the ratio of claims on money (debt assets) to the\\namount of “hard” money there is and the quantity of goods and services there is\\nto buy are too high, the bank is in a bind that it can’t get out of. It simply\\ndoesn’t have enough “hard” money to meet the claims. When that happens to a\\ncentral bank it has the choice either to default or to break the link to the hard\\nmoney, print the money, and devalue it. Inevitably the central bank devalues.\\nWhen these debt restructurings and currency devaluations are too big, they lead\\nto the breakdown and possible destruction of the monetary system. The more\\ndebt (i.e., claims on money and claims on goods and services) there is, the more\\nit will be necessary to devalue the money.\\nRemember, there is always a limited amount of goods and services because\\nthe amount is constrained by the economy’s ability to produce. Also remember\\nthat, as shown in our example of paper money being claims on hard money,\\nthere is a limited amount of that hard money (e.g., gold on deposit), while the\\namount of paper money (the claims on that hard money) and debt (the claims\\non that paper money) is constantly growing. As the amount of paper money\\nclaims grows relative to the amount of hard money in the bank and goods and\\nservices in the economy, the risk increases that the holders of those debt assetsmay not be able to redeem them for the amounts of hard money or goods and\\nservices that they expect to receive for them.\\nA bank that can’t deliver enough hard money to meet the claims being made\\non it is in trouble whether it is a private bank or a central bank, though central\\nbanks have more options than private banks. That’s because a private bank can’t\\nprint the money or change the laws to make it easier to pay their debts, while\\nsome central banks can. Private banks must either default or get bailed out\\nby the government when they get into trouble, while central banks can\\ndevalue their claims (e.g., pay back 50–70 percent) if their debts are\\ndenominated in their national currency. If the debt is denominated in a\\ncurrency that they can’t print, then they too must ultimately default.\\nStage 5: Then comes \\x00at money, which eventually leads to the\\ndebasement of money.\\nCentral banks want to stretch the money and credit cycle to make it last for as\\nlong as it can because that is so much better than the alternative. So when the\\nsystem of hard money and claims on hard money becomes too painfully\\nconstrictive, governments typically abandon it in favor of what is called “\\x00at\\nmoney.” No hard money is involved in \\x00at systems; there is just paper money\\nthat the central bank can print without restriction. As a result, there is no risk\\nthat the central bank will have its stash of hard money drawn down and have to\\ndefault on its promises to deliver it. Rather, the risk is that, freed from the\\nconstraints on the supply of tangible gold, silver, or some other hard asset, the\\npeople who control the printing presses (i.e., the central bankers working with\\nthe commercial bankers) will create ever more money and debt assets and\\nliabilities in relation to the amount of goods and services being produced until\\nthe time comes when those holding the enormous amount of debt will try to\\nturn it in for goods and services, which will have the same e\\x00ect as a run on a\\nbank and result in either debt defaults or the devaluation of money.\\nThe shift from a system in which the debt notes are convertible to a tangible\\nasset (e.g., gold and silver) at a \\x00xed rate to a \\x00at monetary system in which there\\nis no such convertibility last happened in the US on the evening of August 15,\\n1971. As I mentioned earlier, I was watching on TV when President Nixon toldthe world that the dollar would no longer be tied to gold. I thought there would\\nbe pandemonium with stocks falling. Instead, they rose. Because I had never\\nseen a devaluation before, I didn’t understand how it works.\\nIn the years leading up to 1971 the US government had spent a lot of money\\non military and social programs, then referred to as “guns and butter” policy,\\nthat it paid for by borrowing money, which created debt. The debt was a claim\\non money that could be exchanged for gold. Investors treated this debt as an\\nasset because they got paid interest on it and because the US government\\npromised that it would allow the holders of those notes to exchange them for the\\ngold that was held in US vaults. As the spending and budget de\\x00cits grew, the\\nUS had to issue much more debt—i.e., create many more claims on gold—even\\nthough the amount of gold in the bank didn’t increase. Investors who were\\nastute enough to notice could see that the amount of outstanding claims on gold\\nwas much larger than the amount of gold in the bank. They realized that if this\\ncontinued the US would have to default, so they turned in their claims. Of\\ncourse, the idea that the US government, the richest and most powerful\\ngovernment in the world, would default on its promise to give gold to those who\\nhad claims on it seemed implausible at the time. So, while most people were\\nsurprised by Nixon’s announcement and the e\\x00ects on the markets, those who\\nunderstood the mechanics of how money and credit work were not.\\nWhen credit cycles reach their limit, it is the logical and classic\\nresponse for central governments and their central banks to create a lot\\nof debt and print money that will be spent on goods, services, and\\ninvestment assets in order to keep the economy moving. That was done\\nduring the 2008 debt crisis, when interest rates could no longer be lowered\\nbecause they had already hit 0 percent. It also happened in a big way in 2020 in\\nresponse to the plunge triggered by the COVID pandemic. That was also done\\nin response to the 1929–32 debt crisis, when interest rates had similarly been\\ndriven to 0 percent. At the time I am writing this, the creation of debt and\\nmoney has been happening in amounts greater than at any time since World War\\nII.\\nTo be clear, printing money and giving it out for spending rather than\\nsupporting spending with debt growth is not without its bene\\x00ts—mo neyspends like credit, but in practice (rather than in theory) it doesn’t have to be\\npaid back. There is nothing wrong with having an increase in money growth\\ninstead of an increase in credit/debt growth, if the money is put to productive\\nuse. The risk is that it will not be. If money is printed too aggressively and it is\\nnot used productively, people will stop using it as a storehold of wealth and shift\\ntheir wealth into other things.\\nHistory has shown that \\n we shouldn ’t rely on governments to protect us ﬁnancially .\\nOn the contrary, we should expect most governments to abuse their privileged\\npositions as the creators and users of money and credit for the same reasons that\\nyou might commit those abuses if you were in their shoes. That is because no\\none policy maker owns the whole cycle. Each comes in at one or another part of\\nit and does what is in their interest to do given their circumstances at the time\\nand what they believe is best (including breaking promises, even though the way\\nthey collectively handle the whole cycle is bad).\\nSince early in the debt cycle governments are considered trustworthy and they\\nneed and want money as much as or more than anyone else does, they are\\ntypically the biggest borrowers. Later in the cycle, new government leaders and\\nnew central bankers have to face the challenge of paying back debts with less\\nstimulant in the bottle. To make matters worse, governments also have to bail\\nout debtors whose failures would hurt the system—th e “too big to fail”\\nsyndrome. As a result, they tend to get themselves into cash \\x00ow jams that are\\nmuch larger than those of individuals, companies, and most other entities.\\nIn virtually every case, the government contributes to the accumulation of\\ndebt with its actions and by becoming a large debtor itself. When the debt\\nbubble bursts, the government bails itself and others out by buying assets and/or\\nprinting money and devaluing it. The larger the debt crisis, the more that is true.\\nWhile undesirable, it is understandable why this happens. \\n When one can\\nmanufactur e mone y and credit and pass them out to everyone to mak e them happ y, it is very\\nhard to resist the temptation to do so.5 It is a classic \\x00nancial move. Throughout\\nhistory, rulers have run up debts that won’t come due until long after\\ntheir own reigns are over, leaving it to their successors to pay the bill.\\nPrinting money and buying \\x00nancial assets (mostly bonds) holds interest\\nrates down, which stimulates borrowing and buying. Those investors holdingbonds are encouraged to sell them. The low interest rates also encourage\\ninvestors, businesses, and individuals to borrow and invest in higher-returning\\nassets, getting what they want through monthly payments they can a\\x00ord.\\nThis leads central banks to print more money and buy more bonds and\\nsometimes other \\x00nancial assets. That typically does a good job of pushing up\\n\\x00nancial asset prices but is relatively ine\\x00cient at getting money, credit, and\\nbuying power into the hands of those who need them most. That is what\\nhappened in 2008 and what happened for most of the time until the 2020\\ncoronavirus-induced crisis. When money printing and purchasing of \\x00nancial\\nassets fail to get money and credit to where they need to go, the central\\ngovernment borrows money from the central bank (which prints it) so the\\ngovernment can spend it on what it needs to be spent on. The Fed announced\\nthat plan on April 9, 2020. That approach of printing money to buy debt (called\\n“debt monetization”) is vastly more politically palatable as a way of shifting\\nwealth from those who have it to those who need it than imposing taxes because\\nthose who are taxed get angry. That is why central banks always end up\\nprinting money and devaluing.\\nWhen governments print a lot of money and buy a lot of debt, they\\ncheapen both, which essentially taxes those who own it, making it easier\\nfor debtors and borrowers. When this happens to the point that the\\nholders of money and debt assets realize what is going on, they seek to\\nsell their debt assets and/or borrow money to get into debt they can pay\\nback with cheap money. They also often move their wealth into better\\nstoreholds, such as gold and certain types of stocks, or to another country\\nnot having these problems. At such times central banks have typically\\ncontinued to print money and buy debt directly or indirectly (e.g., by\\nhaving banks do the buying for them) while outlawing the \\x00ow of money\\ninto in\\x00ation-hedge assets, alternative currencies, and alternative places.\\nSuch periods of “re\\x00ation” either stimulate a new money and credit\\nexpansion that \\x00nances another economic expansion (which is good for stocks)\\nor devalue the money so that it produces monetary in\\x00ation (which is good for\\nin\\x00ation-hedge assets, such as gold, commodities, and in\\x00ation-linked bonds).\\nEarlier in the long-term debt cycle, when the amount of outstanding debt isn’tlarge and there is a lot of room to stimulate by lowering interest rates (and failing\\nthat, printing money and buying \\x00nancial assets), there is a strong likelihood\\nthat credit growth and economic growth will be good. Later in the long-term\\ndebt cycle, when the amount of debt is large and there isn’t much room to\\nstimulate, there is a much greater likelihood of monetary in\\x00ation accompanied\\nby economic weakness.\\nWhile people tend to believe that a currency is pretty much a\\npermanent thing and that “cash” is the safest asset to hold, that’s not\\ntrue. \\n All currencies devalue or die, and when they do, cash and bonds (which are\\npromises to receiv e currency) are devalued or wiped out. That is because printing a\\nlot of currency and devaluing debt is the most expedient way of reducing\\nor wiping out debt burdens. When debt burdens are su\\x00ciently reduced or\\neliminated, the credit/debt expansion cycles can begin again, as described in the\\nnext chapter.\\nAs I explained comprehensively in my book Principles for Navigating Big\\nDebt Crises, there are four levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt\\nand debt-service levels down relative to the income and cash \\x00ow levels\\nrequired to service debts:\\n1. Austerity (spending less)\\n2. Debt defaults and restructurings\\n3. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they\\nneed to those who have less than they need (e.g., raising taxes)\\n4. Printing money and devaluing it\\nThese levers typically progress from one to another for logical reasons:\\nAusterity is de\\x00ationary and doesn’t last long because it’s too painful.\\nDebt defaults and restructurings are also de\\x00ationary and painful because\\nthe debts that are wiped out or reduced in value are someone’s assets; as a\\nresult, defaults and restructurings are painful for both the debtor who goes\\nbroke and has their assets taken away and for the creditor who loses wealth\\nwhen the debt is written down.Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to\\nthose who have less than they need (e.g., raising taxes to redistribute\\nwealth) is politically challenging but more tolerable than the \\x00rst two ways\\nand is typically part of the resolution.\\nCompared to the others, \\n printing mone y is the most expedient, least well-\\nunderst ood, and most common big wa y of r estructuring debts . In fact, it seems\\ngood rather than bad to most people because:\\nIt helps to relieve debt squeezes.\\nIt’s tough to identify any harmed parties that the wealth was taken\\naway from to provide this \\x00nancial wealth (though they are the\\nholders of money and debt assets).\\nIn most cases it causes assets to go up in the depreciating currency\\nthat people measure their wealth in, so it appears that people are\\ngetting richer.\\nThis is what has been happening during the coronavirus crisis as central\\ngovernments and banks send out large amounts of money and credit. Note that\\nyou don’t hear anyone complaining about the money and credit creation; in fact,\\npeople say that governments would be cheap and cruel if they didn’t provide a\\nlot more of it. Hardly anyone acknowledges that governments don’t actually\\nhave this money to give out. Governments aren’t rich entities with piles of\\nmoney lying around. They are just their people collectively, who will ultimately\\nhave to pay for the creation and giving out of money. Now imagine what those\\nsame citizens would say if government o\\x00cials cut expenses to balance their\\nbudgets and asked them to do the same, making lots of them go broke, and/or if\\nthey sought to redistribute wealth from those who have more to those who have\\nless by raising taxes. The money and credit producing path is much more\\nacceptable politically than either of those options. It’s as if you changed the rules\\nof Monopoly to allow the banker to make more money and redistribute it\\nwhenever too many players are going broke and getting angry.\\nStage 6: Then the \\x00ight back into hard money.\\nWhen taken too far, the overprinting of \\x00at currency leads to the\\nselling of debt assets and the earlier-described “bank run” dynamic,which ultimately reduces the value of money and credit, which prompts\\npeople to \\x00ee out of both the currency and the debt. History teaches us that\\npeople typically turn to gold, silver, stocks that maintain their real value, and\\ncurrencies and assets in other countries not having these problems. Some people\\nthink that there has to be an alternative reserve currency to go to for this \\x00ight to\\nhappen, but that’s not true as the same dynamic of the breakdown of the\\nmonetary system and the running to other assets has happened in cases in which\\nthere was no alternative currency (e.g., in dynastic China and during the Roman\\nEmpire). There are a lot of things people run to when money is devalued,\\nincluding rocks (used for construction) in Germany’s Weimar Republic. The\\ndebasement of the currency leads people to run from it and from debt\\ndenominated in it and into something else.\\nAt this stage of the debt cycle there is typically economic stress caused by\\nlarge wealth and values gaps. These gaps lead to higher taxes and \\x00ghting\\nbetween the rich and the poor. This also makes those with wealth want to move\\nto hard assets, other currencies, and other countries. Naturally those who are\\ngoverning the countries that are su\\x00ering from this \\x00ight from their debt, their\\ncurrency, and their country want to stop it. So governments make it harder to\\ninvest in assets like gold (by outlawing gold transactions and ownership, for\\nexample), foreign currencies (via eliminating the ability to transact in them), and\\nforeign countries (by establishing foreign exchange controls to prevent money\\nfrom leaving the country). Eventually the debt is largely wiped out, usually by\\nmaking the money to pay it back plentiful and cheap, which devalues both the\\nmoney and the debt.\\nWhen the devaluations and defaults become so extreme that the\\nmoney and credit system breaks down, necessity generally compels\\ngovernments to go back to some form of hard currency to rebuild\\npeople’s faith in the value of money as a storehold of wealth. Quite often,\\nthough not always, the government links its money to gold or a hard reserve\\ncurrency with a promise to allow holders of that new money to convert it to the\\nhard money. Sometimes that hard money is another country’s. For example, over\\nthe past decades many weak-currency countries have linked their money to theUS dollar or simply dollarized their economy (i.e., used the dollar as their own\\nmedium of exchange and storehold of wealth).\\nTo review, holding debt as an asset that provides interest is typically\\nrewarding early in the long-term debt cycle when there isn’t a lot of debt\\noutstanding, but holding debt late in the cycle, when there is a lot of debt\\noutstanding and it is closer to being defaulted on or devalued, is risky\\nrelative to the interest rate being given. So, holding debt is a bit like holding\\na ticking time bomb that rewards you while it is still ticking and blows you up\\nwhen it stops. And as we’ve seen, that big blowup (i.e., big default or big\\ndevaluation) happens something like once every 50 to 75 years.\\nThese cycles of building debts and writing o\\x00 debts have existed for\\nthousands of years and in some cases have been institutionalized. For example,\\nthe Old Testament describes a year of Jubilee every 50 years, in which debts were\\nforgiven. Knowing that the debt cycle would happen on that schedule allowed\\neveryone to act in a rational way to prepare for it.\\nHelping you understand this debt cycle so that you are prepared for it, rather\\nthan surprised by it, is my main objective in writing this book.\\nIronically, the closer most people are to the blowup, which is also when\\nthe claims outstanding are largest relative to the amount of hard money\\nand tangible wealth there is, the riskier the situation is but the safer\\npeople tend to feel. That is because they have held the debt and enjoyed\\nthe rewards of doing so. The longer it has been since the last blowup, the\\nmore people’s memories of it have faded—even as the risks of holding the\\ndebt rise and the rewards for holding it decline. To properly assess the\\nrisk/reward of holding the time bomb, one must remain constantly aware of the\\namount of debt that needs to be paid relative to the amount of hard money there\\nis to pay it, the amount of debt payments that have to be made relative to the\\namount of cash \\x00ow the debtors have, and the amount of interest they bring in.\\nTHE LONG-TERM DEBT CYCLE IN SUMMARYFor thousands of years, there have always been three types of monetary\\nsystems:\\nType 1: Hard money (e.g., metal coins)\\nType 2: Paper money (claims on hard money)\\nType 3: Fiat money\\nHard money is the most restrictive system because money can’t be\\ncreated unless the supply of the metal or other intrinsically valuable\\ncommodity that is the money is increased. Money and credit are more\\neasily created in the second type of system, so the ratio of the claims on\\nhard money to the actual hard money held rises, which eventually leads\\nto a run on the banks. The result is a) defaults, when the bank closes its\\ndoors and depositors lose their hard assets, and/or b) devaluations of the\\nclaims on money, which mean depositors get back less. In the third type\\nof system, governments can create money and credit freely, which works\\nfor as long as people continue to have con\\x00dence in the currency and fails\\nwhen they no longer do.\\nThroughout history, countries have transitioned across these di\\x00erent types\\nof systems for logical reasons. When a country needs more money and credit\\nthan it currently has, whether to deal with debts, wars, or other problems, it\\nnaturally moves from Type 1 to Type 2, or Type 2 to Type 3, so that it has more\\n\\x00exibility to print money. Then creating too much money and debt depreciates\\ntheir value, causing people to get out of holding debt and money as a storehold\\nof wealth and move back into hard assets (like gold and silver) and other\\ncurrencies. Since this typically takes place when there is wealth con\\x00ict and\\nsometimes war, there is also typically a desire to get out of the country. Such\\ncountries need to re-establish con\\x00dence in their currency as a storehold of\\nwealth before they can restore their credit markets.\\nThe following diagram conveys these di\\x00erent transitions. There are many\\nhistorical examples, from the Song Dynasty in China to Weimar Germany, of\\ncountries making the full transition from constrained types of monetary systems\\n(Type 1 and Type 2) to \\x00at money (Type 3), then back to a constrained currency\\nas the \\x00at currency hyperin\\x00ates.This big cycle typically plays out over something like 50 to 75 years;\\nits ending is characterized by a restructuring of debts and the monetary\\nsystem itself. The abrupt parts of these restructurings—i.e., the periods\\nof debt and currency crisis—typically happen quickly, lasting only a few\\nmonths to up to three years, depending on how long it takes the\\ngovernment to act. However, their ripple e\\x00ects can be long-lasting, for\\nexample, when a currency ceases to be a reserve currency. Within each of\\nthese currency regimes there are typically two to four big debt crises—i.e., big\\nenough to cause banking crises and debt write-downs or devaluations of 30\\npercent or more—but not big enough to break the currency system. Because I\\nhave invested in many countries for nearly half a century, I have experienced\\ndozens of them. They all run the same way, which I explain in greater depth in\\nmy book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises.\\nIn the next chapter, I will go into more detail on the causes of and risks\\nassociated with money changing its value, showing what has happened in the\\npast, which is pretty shocking.\\n1 You can \\x00nd more of my perspective on this in several papers at economicprinciples.org.\\n2 While borrowers are typically willing to pay interest, which is what gives lenders the incentive to lend,\\nnowadays there are some debt assets that have negative interest rates, which is a weird story that we will\\nexplore later.\\n3 Monetized means the central bank’s creation of money to buy debt.\\n4 By the way, please understand that these rough estimates of cycle times are just rough estimates, and to\\nknow where we are in these cycles we need to look more at the conditions than the amount of time.\\n5 Some central banks have made acting on this temptation harder by separating themselves from the direct\\ncontrol of politicians, but virtually every central bank has to bail out their government at some point, so\\ndevaluations always happen.CHAPTER 4\\nTHE CHANGING VALUE OF MONEY\\nThis chapter examines the concepts introduced in the prior chapter in a more\\ngranular way to show you how consistent they are with the actual cases they are\\nderived from. While we will get a bit more into the mechanics here than we did\\nin Chapter 3, I have written this chapter in a way that should be accessible to the\\ngeneral reader and, at the same time, precise enough to satisfy the needs of skilled\\neconomists and investors.\\nAs previously explained, there is a real economy and there is a\\n\\x00nancial economy, and the two are closely entwined but di\\x00erent. Each\\nhas its own supply-and-demand dynamics. In this chapter we will focus\\non the supply-and-demand dynamics of the \\x00nancial economy to explore\\nwhat determines the value of money.\\nMost people worry about whether their assets are going up or down;\\nthey rarely pay much attention to the value of their currency. Think about\\nit. How worried are you about your currency declining? And how worried are\\nyou about how your stocks or your other assets are doing? If you are like most\\npeople, you are not nearly as aware of your currency risk as you need to be.\\nSo, let’s explore currency risks.\\nALL CURRENCIES ARE DEVALUED OR DIE\\nOf the roughly 750 currencies that have existed since 1700, only about\\n20 percent remain, and all of them have been devalued. If you went back to1850, as an example, the world’s major currencies wouldn’t look anything like\\nthe ones today. While the dollar, pound, and Swiss franc existed in 1850, the\\nmost important currencies of that era have died. In what is now Germany, you\\nwould have used the gulden or the thaler. There was no yen, so in Japan you\\nmight have used the koban or the ryo instead. In Italy you would have used one\\nor more of six currencies. You would have used di\\x00erent currencies in Spain,\\nChina, and most other countries as well. Some were completely wiped out (in\\nmost cases they were in countries that had hyperin\\x00ation and/or lost wars and\\nhad large war debts) and replaced by entirely new currencies. Some were merged\\ninto currencies that replaced them (e.g., the individual European currencies were\\nmerged into the euro). And some remain in existence but were devalued, like the\\nBritish pound and the US dollar.\\nWHAT DO THEY DEVALUE AGAINST?\\nThe goal of printing money is to reduce debt burdens, so the most\\nimportant thing for currencies to devalue against is debt (i.e., increase\\nthe amount of money relative to the amount of debt, to make it easier for\\ndebtors to repay). Debt is a promise to deliver money, so giving more\\nmoney to those who need it lessens their debt burden. Where this newly\\ncreated money and credit then \\x00ow determines what happens next. In cases in\\nwhich debt relief facilitates the \\x00ow of this money and credit into\\nproductivity and pro\\x00ts for companies, real stock prices (i.e., the value of\\nstocks after adjusting for in\\x00ation) rise.\\nWhen the creation of money su\\x00ciently hurts the actual and\\nprospective returns of cash and debt assets, it drives \\x00ows out of those\\nassets and into in\\x00ation-hedge assets like gold, commodities, in\\x00ation-\\nindexed bonds, and other currencies (including digital). This leads to a\\nself-reinforcing decline in the value of money. At times when the central\\nbank faces the choice between allowing real interest rates (i.e., the rate of interest\\nminus the rate of in\\x00ation) to rise to the detriment of the economy (and theanger of most of the public) or preventing real interest rates from rising by\\nprinting money and buying those cash and debt assets, they will choose the\\nsecond path. This reinforces the bad returns of holding cash and those debt\\nassets.\\nThe later in the long-term debt cycle this happens, the greater the likelihood\\nthere will be a breakdown in the currency and monetary system. This\\nbreakdown is most likely to occur when the amounts of debt and money are\\nalready too large to be turned into real value for the amounts of goods and\\nservices they are claims on, the level of real interest rates that is low enough to\\nsave debtors from bankruptcy is below the level required for creditors to hold the\\ndebt as a viable storehold of wealth, and the normal central bank levers of\\nallocating capital via interest rate changes (which I call Monetary Policy 1, or\\nMP1) and/or printing money and buying high-quality debt (Monetary Policy 2,\\nor MP2) don’t work. This turns monetary policy into a facilitator of a political\\nsystem that allocates resources in an uneconomic way.\\nThere are systemically bene\\x00cial devaluations (though they are always\\ncostly to holders of money and debt), and there are systemically\\ndestructive ones that damage the credit/capital allocation system but are\\nneeded to wipe out debt in order to create a new monetary order. It’s\\nimportant to be able to tell the di\\x00erence.\\nTo do that I will start by showing how the values of currencies have\\nchanged in relation to both gold and consumer-price-index-weighted\\nbaskets of goods and services. These are relevant comparisons because\\ngold is the timeless and universal alternative currency, while money is\\nmeant to buy goods and services so its buying power is of paramount\\nimportance. I will also touch on how a currency’s value changes in\\nrelation to other currencies/debt and in relation to stocks because they\\ntoo can be storeholds of wealth. The picture that all these measures convey is\\nbroadly similar when a devaluation is big enough. Many other things (real estate,\\nart, etc.) are also alternative storeholds of wealth, but gold will make my point\\nnicely.IN RELATION TO GOLD\\nThis chart shows spot exchange rates of the three major reserve\\ncurrencies in relation to gold since 1600. We will examine all of this in\\ndepth later. For now I would like to focus on both the spot currency returns\\nand the total returns of interest-earning cash in all the major currencies since\\n1850.\\nAs the next two charts show, devaluations typically occur fairly\\nabruptly during debt crises that are separated by longer periods of\\nprosperity and stability. I noted six devaluations, but of course there were\\nmany more of minor currencies.\\nTo properly compare the returns of holding cash in a currency to gold, we\\nhave to take into account the interest one would earn on cash. This chart showsthe total return (i.e., price changes plus interest earned) on cash in each major\\ncurrency versus gold.\\n1\\nHere are the most notable takeaways:\\nBig devaluations are abrupt and episodic rather than evolutionary.\\nOver the last 170 years, there were six time frames when really big\\ndevaluations of major currencies occurred (and plenty more of minor\\ncurrencies).\\nIn the 1860s, during its civil war, the US suspended gold convertibility and\\nprinted paper money (known as “greenbacks”) to help monetize war debts.\\nAround the time the US returned to its gold peg in the mid-1870s, a\\nnumber of other countries joined the gold standard; most currencies\\nremained \\x00xed against it until World War I. Major exceptions were Japan\\n(which was on a silver-linked standard until the 1890s, which led its\\nexchange rate to devalue against gold as silver prices fell during this period)\\nand Spain, which frequently suspended convertibility to support large\\n\\x00scal de\\x00cits.\\nDuring World War I, warring countries ran enormous de\\x00cits that were\\nfunded by central banks’ printing and lending of money. Gold served as\\nmoney in foreign transactions, as international trust (and hence credit) was\\nlacking. When the war ended, a new monetary order was created with gold\\nand the winning countries’ currencies, which were tied to gold.Still, between 1919 and 1922 several European countries, especially those\\nthat lost the war, were forced to print and devalue their currencies. The\\nGerman mark and German mark debt sank between 1920 and 1923. Some\\nof the winners of the war also had debts that had to be devalued to create a\\nnew start.\\nWith debt, domestic political, and international geopolitical restructurings\\ndone, the 1920s boomed, particularly in the US, in\\x00ating a debt bubble.\\nThe debt bubble burst in 1929, requiring central banks to print money and\\ndevalue it throughout the 1930s. More money printing and more money\\ndevaluations were required during World War II to fund military spending.\\nIn 1944–45, as the war ended, a new monetary system that linked the\\ndollar to gold and other currencies to the dollar was created. The currencies\\nand debts of Germany, Japan, and Italy, as well as those of China and a\\nnumber of other countries, were quickly and totally destroyed, while those\\nof most winners of the war were slowly but still substantially depreciated.\\nThis monetary system stayed in place until the late 1960s.\\nIn 1968–73 (most importantly in 1971), excessive spending and debt\\ncreation (especially by the US) required breaking the dollar’s link to gold\\nbecause the claims on gold that were being turned in were far greater than\\nthe amount of gold available to redeem them.\\nThat led to a dollar-based \\x00at monetary system, which allowed the big\\nincrease in dollar-denominated money and credit that fueled the in\\x00ation\\nof the 1970s and led to the debt crisis of the 1980s.\\nSince 2000, the value of money has fallen in relation to the value of gold\\ndue to money and credit creation and because interest rates have been low\\nin relation to in\\x00ation rates. Because the monetary system has been free-\\n\\x00oating, it hasn’t experienced the abrupt breaks it did in the past; the\\ndevaluation has been more gradual and continuous. Low, and in some cases\\nnegative, interest rates have not provided compensation for the increasing\\namount of money and credit and the resulting (albeit low) in\\x00ation.\\nNow let’s take a closer look at these events:The returns from holding currencies (in short-term debt that collects\\ninterest) were generally pro\\x00table between 1850 and 1913 relative to the\\nreturns from holding gold. Most currencies were able to remain \\x00xed\\nagainst gold or silver, and lending and borrowing worked well for those\\nwho did it. That prosperous period is called the Second Industrial\\nRevolution, when borrowers turned the money they borrowed into\\nearnings that allowed their debts to be paid back at high interest rates.\\nTimes were turbulent nevertheless. For example, in the early 1900s in the\\nUS, a debt-\\x00nanced speculative boom in stocks grew overextended,\\ncausing a banking and brokerage crisis. That led to the Panic of 1907, at the\\nsame time that the large wealth gap and other social issues (e.g., women’s\\nsu\\x00rage and trade unionization) were causing political tensions. Capitalism\\nwas challenged, and taxes started to rise to fund the wealth\\nredistribution process. Both the Federal Reserve and the US federal income\\ntax were instituted in 1913.\\nThough a world away, China was impacted by the same dynamic. A stock\\nmarket bubble led by rubber production stocks (China’s equivalent of the\\nrailroad stock bubbles that contributed to panics in the US throughout the 19th\\ncentury) burst in 1910, causing the crash that some have described as a factor in\\nthe debt/money/economic downswing that brought about the end of Imperial\\nChina.\\nBut throughout most of that period, Type 2 monetary systems (i.e.,\\nthose with notes convertible into metal money) remained in place in most\\ncountries, and the holders of those notes got paid good interest rates\\nwithout having their currencies devalued. The big exceptions were the US\\ndevaluation to \\x00nance its civil war debts in the 1860s, the frequent devaluations\\nof Spain’s currency due to its weakness as a global power, and the sharp\\ndevaluations in Japan’s currency due to its remaining on a silver-linked standard\\nuntil the 1890s, while silver prices were falling relative to gold.When World War I began in 1914, countries borrowed a lot to fund\\nit. This led to the late-debt-cycle breakdowns and devaluations that came\\nwhen war debts had to be wiped out, e\\x00ectively destroying the monetary\\nsystems of the war’s losers. The Paris Peace Conference that ended the war in\\n1918 attempted to institute a new international order around the League of\\nNations, but those e\\x00orts at cooperation could not forestall the debt crises and\\nmonetary instability caused by the huge war indemnities that were placed on the\\ndefeated powers, as well as the large war debts that the victorious Allied powers\\nowed each other (particularly the US).\\nGermany su\\x00ered a complete wipeout of the value of money and\\ncredit, which led to the most iconic hyperin\\x00ation in history during the\\nWeimar Republic (which I describe in great detail in Principles for Navigating\\nBig Debt Crises). The Spanish \\x00u pandemic also occurred during the period,\\nbeginning in 1918 and ending in 1920. With the exception of the US,\\nvirtually every country devalued its currency because they had to\\nmonetize some of their war debts. Had they not done so, they wouldn’t have\\nbeen able to compete in world markets with the countries that did. China’s\\nsilver-based currency rallied sharply relative to gold (and gold-linked currencies)\\nnear the end of the war as silver prices rose, and then mechanically devalued as\\nsilver prices fell sharply amid the post-war de\\x00ation in the US. That period of\\nwar and devaluation that established the new world order in 1918 was\\nfollowed by an extended and productive period of economic prosperity,\\nparticularly in the US, known as the Roaring ’20s. Like all such periods,\\nit led to big debt and asset bubbles and large wealth gaps.Di\\x00erent versions of the same thing happened during the 1930s.\\nBetween 1930 and 1933, a global debt crisis caused economic\\ncontractions that led to money printing and competitive devaluations in\\nvirtually every country, eroding the value of money moving into World\\nWar II. Con\\x00icts over wealth within countries led to greater con\\x00icts between\\nthem. All the warring countries built up war debts while the US gained a lot of\\nwealth in the form of gold during the war. Then, after the war, the value of\\nmoney and debt was completely wiped out for the losers (Germany,\\nJapan, and Italy) as well as for China, and was severely devalued for the\\nUK and France, even though they were among the winners. A new world\\norder and a period of prosperity followed the war. We won’t examine it,\\nother than to mention that the excessive borrowing that took place set in motion\\nthe next big devaluation, which happened between 1968 and 1973.\\nBy the mid-1950s, the dollar and the Swiss franc were the only\\ncurrencies worth even half of their 1850s exchange rate. As shown in thefollowing chart, the downward pressure on currencies and upward pressure on\\ngold started in 1968. On August 15, 1971, President Nixon ended the\\nBretton Woods monetary system, devaluing the dollar and leaving the\\nmonetary system in which the dollar was backed by gold and instituting\\na \\x00at monetary system. (I will cover this episode in more detail in\\nChapter 11.)\\nSince 2000, we have seen a more gradual and orderly loss of total return in\\ncurrencies when measured in gold, consistent with the broad fall in real rates\\nacross countries.\\nIn summary:\\nThe average annual return of interest-earning cash currency between 1850\\nand the present was 1.2 percent, which was a bit higher than the averagereal return of holding gold, which was 0.9 percent, though there were huge\\ndi\\x00erences in returns at various periods of time and in various countries.\\nYou would have received a positive real return for holding bills in about half\\nof the countries during that period and a negative real return in the other\\nhalf. In the case of Germany, you would have been totally wiped out twice.\\nMost of the real returns from holding interest-earning cash currency would\\nhave come in the periods of prosperity, when most countries were on gold\\nstandards that they adhered to (e.g., during the Second Industrial\\nRevolution, when debt levels and debt-service burdens were relatively low\\nand income growth was nearly equal to debt growth).\\nThe real return for bills since 1912 (the modern \\x00at era) has been -0.1\\npercent. The real return of gold during this era has been 1.6 percent. You\\nwould only have made a positive real return holding interest-earning cash\\ncurrency in about half of the countries during this era, and you would have\\nlost meaningfully in the rest (over 2 percent a year in France, Italy, and\\nJapan, and over 18 percent a year in Germany, due to the hyperin\\x00ation).\\nCURRENCY AND GOLD REAL RE TURNS OF M AJOR COUN TRIES\\nSINCE 1850 ( VS CPI, ANN)\\nCountr y Real Returns (vs CPI), A nn\\n1850–Pr esent 1850–1912 1912–Pr esent\\nContinuous\\nGovt Bill\\nInvestmentGold Continuous\\nGovt Bill\\nInvestmentGold Continuous\\nGovt Bill\\nInvestmentGold\\nUnited Kingdom 1.4% 0.7% 3.1% -0.1% 0.5% 1.1%\\nUnited States 1.6% 0.3% 3.6% -1.0% 0.4% 1.0%\\nGermany -12.9% 2.0% 3.0% -0.9% -18.2% 3.1%\\nFrance -0.7% 0.6% 2.6% -0.3% -2.6% 1.1%\\nItaly -0.6% 0.3% 4.7% -0.5% -2.6% 0.5%\\nJapan -0.7% 1.0% 5.0% 0.4% -2.2% 1.2%\\nSwitz erland 1.5% 0.0% 3.4% -0.5% 0.5% 0.3%\\nSpain 1.4% 1.1% 4.5% 0.1% 0.3% 1.5%\\nNetherlands 1.4% 0.5% 3.3% 0.0% 0.4% 0.7%Countr y Real Returns (vs CPI), A nn\\n1850–Pr esent 1850–1912 1912–Pr esent\\nContinuous\\nGovt Bill\\nInvestmentGold Continuous\\nGovt Bill\\nInvestmentGold Continuous\\nGovt Bill\\nInvestmentGold\\nChina — 3.3% — — — 3.3%\\nAverage 1.2% 0.9% 3.6% -0.3% -0.1% 1.6%\\nData for Switz erland is since 1851; data for Germany , Spain, and Italy is since 1870; data\\nfor Japan is since 1882; data for China is since 1926 (ex cluding 1948–50). A verage r eturn\\nis un-r ebalanced and doesn ’t include China.\\nThe next chart shows the real returns from holding gold between 1850 and\\nthe present. From 1850 to 1971, gold returned (through its appreciation) an\\namount that roughly equaled the amount of money lost to in\\x00ation on average,\\nthough there were big variations around that average both across countries (e.g.,\\nGermany seeing large gold outperformance, while countries with only limited\\ndevaluations, like the US, saw gold prices not keep up with in\\x00ation) and across\\ntime (e.g., the 1930s currency devaluations and the World War II-era\\ndevaluations of money that were part of the formation of the Bretton Woods\\nmonetary system in 1944). After the war, gold stayed steady in price across most\\ncountries, while money and credit expanded until 1971. Then, in 1971, there\\nwas a shift from a Type 2 monetary system (notes backed by gold) to a Type 3\\n\\x00at monetary system. That delinking of currencies from gold gave central banks\\nthe unconstrained ability to create money and credit. That led to high in\\x00ation\\nand low real interest rates, which led to the big appreciation in the real gold price\\nuntil 1980–81, when interest rates were raised signi\\x00cantly above the in\\x00ation\\nrate, leading currencies to strengthen and gold to fall until 2000. That is when\\ncentral banks pushed interest rates down relative to in\\x00ation rates and, when\\nthey couldn’t push rates any lower by normal means, printed money and bought\\n\\x00nancial assets, which supported gold prices.THE VALUE OF CURRENCIES IN RELATION TO\\nGOODS AND SERVICES\\nThus far we have looked at the market values of currencies in relation to the\\nmarket value of gold. That raises the question as to whether gold is an\\nappropriate gauge of value. The next chart shows the value of interest-\\nearning currency in terms of the consumer price index (CPI) baskets of\\ngoods and services in those currencies, re\\x00ecting their changes in buying\\npower. As can be clearly seen, the two World Wars were very bad and there have\\nbeen ups and downs in the years since. For about half of the currencies, interest-\\nearning cash provided a return above the rate of in\\x00ation. For the other half it\\nprovided negative real returns. In all cases, there were big and roughly 10-year-\\nlong swings around those averages. In other words, history has shown that\\nthere are very large risks in holding interest-earning cash currency as a\\nstorehold of wealth, especially late in debt cycles.\\nTHE PATTERNS OF COUNTRIES DEVALUING\\nAND LOSING THEIR RESERVE CURRENCY\\nSTATUS\\nA currency devaluing and a currency losing its reserve currency status\\naren’t necessarily the same, though both are caused by debt crises. The\\nloss of reserve currency status is a product of chronic large devaluations.\\nAs previously explained, increasing the supply of money and credit reduces the\\nvalue of money and credit. This is bad for holders of money and credit but a\\nrelief to debtors. When this debt relief allows money and credit to \\x00ow into\\nproductivity and pro\\x00ts for companies, real stock prices rise. But it can also\\ndamage the actual and prospective returns of cash and debt assets enough to\\ndrive people out of them and into in\\x00ation-hedge assets and other currencies.\\nThe central bank then prints money and buys cash and debt assets, which\\nreinforces the bad returns of holding them. The later in the long-term debt cycle\\nthis happens, the greater the likelihood that there will be a breakdown in the\\ncurrency and monetary system. Policy makers and investors must be able to tell\\nthe di\\x00erence between systemically bene\\x00cial devaluations and systemically\\ndestructive ones.\\nWhat do these devaluations have in common?\\nAll the economies in the major cases that we examine in depth in\\nPart II experienced a classic “run” dynamic, in which there were\\nmore claims on the central bank than there was hard currency\\navailable to satisfy them. That hard currency was typically gold, though\\nit was US dollars for the UK reserve currency decline because at that time\\nthe pound was linked to the dollar.\\nNet central bank reserves start falling prior to the actual\\ndevaluation, in some cases years ahead. It’s also worth noting that in\\nseveral cases countries suspended convertibility before the actualdevaluation of the exchange rate. The UK did this in 1947 and ahead of the\\n1949 devaluation, and the US did it in 1971.\\nThe run on the currency and the devaluations typically occur\\nalongside signi\\x00cant debt problems, often related to wartime spending\\n(e.g., the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War for the Netherlands, the World Wars\\nfor the UK, and the Vietnam War for the US), which put pressure on the\\ncentral bank to print. The worst situations are when countries lose wars;\\nthat typically leads to the total collapse and restructuring of their currencies\\nand their economies. However, winners of wars that end up with debts\\nmuch larger than their assets and reduced competitiveness (e.g., the UK\\nafter the World Wars) also lose their reserve currency status, though more\\ngradually.\\nTypically, central banks initially respond by letting short-term rates\\nrise, but that is too economically painful, so they quickly capitulate\\nand increase the supply of money. After the money devalues, they\\ntypically cut rates.\\nOutcomes diverge signi\\x00cantly across the cases, with a key variable\\nbeing how much economic and military power the country retains\\nat the time of the devaluation. The more it has, the more willing savers\\nare to continue holding their money there. More speci\\x00cally for the major\\nreserve currencies:\\nFor the Dutch, the collapse of the guilder was massive and relatively\\nquick; it took place over less than a decade, with the actual circulation\\nof guilders falling swiftly by the end of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War\\nin 1784. The collapse came as the Netherlands entered a steep decline\\nas a world power, \\x00rst losing to the British and subsequently facing\\ninvasion from France.\\nFor the UK, the decline was more gradual: it took two devaluations\\nbefore it fully lost its reserve currency status after Bretton Woods,\\nthough it experienced periodic balance of payments strains over the\\nintervening period. Many who held reserves in pounds continued to\\ndo so because of political pressures, and their assets signi\\x00cantly\\nunderperformed US assets during the same time.In the case of the US, there were two big abrupt devaluations (in 1933\\nand 1971) and more gradual devaluations against gold since 2000, but\\nthey haven’t cost the US its reserve currency status.\\nTypically, a country loses its reserve currency status when there is an\\nalready established loss of economic and political primacy to a rising\\nrival, which creates a vulnerability (e.g., the Netherlands falling\\nbehind the UK, or the UK falling behind the US), and there are large\\nand growing debts monetized by the central bank printing money and\\nbuying government debt. This leads to a weakening of the currency in\\na self-reinforcing run that can’t be stopped because the \\x00scal and\\nbalance of payments de\\x00cits are too great for any cutbacks to close.\\nIn Part II, we will see the last 500 years of history as one continuous\\nstory of rises and declines of empires and the reasons for them, and you\\nwill see the same cause/e\\x00ect relationships driving the rises and declines.\\nBut \\x00rst we need to explore the big cycles of internal and external\\norder/disorder, which we will do in the next two chapters.\\n1 Due to a lack of data, several charts in this chapter do not show China.CHAPTER 5\\nTHE BIG CYCLE OF INTERNAL ORDER\\nAND DISORDER\\nHow people are with each other is the primary driver of the outcomes\\nthey get. Within countries there are systems or “orders” for governing\\nhow people are supposed to behave with each other. These systems and\\nthe actual behaviors of people operating within them produce\\nconsequences. In this chapter, we will explore the timeless and universal\\ncause/e\\x00ect relationships that shape the internal orders and the\\nbehaviors that drive the shifts between periods of order and periods of\\ndisorder.\\nThrough my research, I saw how changes in internal orders (i.e., countries’\\nsystems for governing internally) and changes in the world order (i.e., the\\nsystems determining power between countries) happen continuously and\\neverywhere in similar and increasingly interconnected ways that \\x00ow together as\\none all-encompassing story from the beginning of recorded time up to this\\nmoment. Seeing many interlinking cases evolve together helped me to discover\\nthe patterns that govern them and to imagine the future based on what I’ve\\nlearned. Most importantly I saw how the constant struggle for wealth and power\\nproduced continuously evolving internal systems/orders and external\\nsystems/orders and saw how these internal and external orders a\\x00ect each other\\n—with the whole thing (i.e., the world order) working like a perpetual-motion\\nmachine that evolves while doing the same things over and over again for\\nbasically the same reasons. The biggest thing affecting most people in most countries through time is how people\\nstruggle to mak e, take, and distribute wealth and power , though they also struggle over\\nother things, most impor tantly ideology and religion.  I saw how these struggles\\nhappened in timeless and universal ways, and how these struggles had\\nhuge implications for all aspects of people’s lives, starting with what\\nhappened with taxes, the economy, and how people were with each other\\nthrough periods of boom and bust and peace and war, and how they\\nunfolded in cyclical ways, like the tide coming in and out.\\nI saw that when these struggles took the form of healthy competition that\\nencouraged human energy to be put into productive activities, they produced\\nproductive internal orders and prosperous times, and when those energies took\\nthe form of destructive internal \\x00ghting, they produced internal disorder and\\npainfully di\\x00cult times. I saw why the swings between productive order and\\ndestructive disorder typically evolved in cycles driven by logical cause/e\\x00ect\\nrelationships and how they happened in all countries for mostly the same\\nreasons. I saw that those that rose to achieve greatness did so because of a\\ncon\\x00uence of key forces coming together to produce that greatness and those\\nthat declined did so because these forces dissipated.\\nAt the time of this writing, there is growing disorder in a number of leading\\ncountries around the world, most importantly in the United States. I wanted to\\nput that disorder into perspective so I built indices of it and conducted the\\nresearch I am sharing in this chapter. Because how the US handles its disorder\\nwill have profound implications for Americans, others around the world, and\\nmost economies and markets, in this chapter I am focusing more on the US than\\non other countries.\\nThis simpli\\x00ed chart shows approximately where the US and China are\\nwithin the archetypical Big Cycle, as measured by the previously described\\ndeterminants. The US is in the stage—w hich I call Stage 5—w hen there are bad\\n\\x00nancial conditions and intensifying con\\x00ict at the same time the leading\\nempire still has other great strengths (e.g., technology and military) that are\\ndeclining on a relative basis. Classically this stage comes after periods of great\\nexcesses in spending and debt and the widening of wealth and political gaps and\\nbefore there are revolutions and civil wars.To be clear, I am not saying that the United States or other countries are\\ninevitably headed into a period of greater decline or more internal and external\\ncon\\x00ict. However, I am saying that it is important to watch the markers in order\\nto understand both what is happening and the full range of possibilities for the\\nperiod ahead. In this chapter, I explore those markers by drawing on the lessons\\nfrom analogous historical cases.\\nTHE SIX STAGES OF THE INTERNAL CYCLE\\nInternal orders typically (though not always) change through a relatively\\nstandard sequence of stages, like the progression of a disease. By looking at\\ntheir symptoms we can tell which stages countries are in. For example, just as\\nStage 3 cancer is di\\x00erent from Stage 4 cancer in ways de\\x00ned by di\\x00erent\\nconditions that exist and have come about as a result of things that happened in\\nprior stages, the same is true for the di\\x00erent stages of the big internal cycle. Like\\ndiseases, di\\x00erent conditions warrant di\\x00erent actions to address them and they\\nproduce a di\\x00erent range of probabilities that those actions will lead to. For\\nexample, an old, unhealthy set of circumstances produces a range of possibilities\\nand warrants di\\x00erent actions than a young, healthy set. As with cancer, it is\\nbest to stop the progress before getting into the later stages.\\nFrom studying history it appears to me that the stages of the archetypical\\ncycle from internal order to internal disorder and back are as follows:\\nStage 1, when the new order begins and the new leadership\\nconsolidates power, which leads to…… Stage 2, when the resource-allocation systems and government\\nbureaucracies are built and re\\x00ned, which if done well leads to…\\n… Stage 3, when there is peace and prosperity, which leads to…\\n… Stage 4, when there are great excesses in spending and debt and\\nthe widening of wealth and political gaps, which leads to…\\n… Stage 5, when there are very bad \\x00nancial conditions and intense\\ncon\\x00ict, which leads to…\\n… Stage 6, when there are civil wars/revolutions, which leads to…\\n… Stage 1, which leads to Stage 2, etc., with the whole cycle happening over\\nagain.\\nEach stage presents a di\\x00erent set of conditions that the people facing them\\nhave to deal with. Some of these circumstances are much more di\\x00cult than\\nothers to resolve. For example, early in the long-term debt cycle, when there is\\nplenty of capacity for governments to create debt to \\x00nance spending, it is easier\\nto deal with the circumstances at hand than late in the long-term debt cycle\\nwhen there is little or no capacity to create money and credit to \\x00nance\\nspending. For these reasons the range of possible paths forward and the\\nchallenges that leaders face depend on where in the cycle a country is. These\\ndi\\x00erent stages present di\\x00erent challenges that require di\\x00erent qualities,\\nunderstandings, and skills from leaders in order to e\\x00ectively deal with them.1\\nHow well those facing these circumstances—e.g., you facing your circumstances\\nand our leaders facing our collective circumstances—understand and adapt to\\nthem a\\x00ects how good or bad the outcomes will be within the range of\\npossibilities that exist given the circumstances. Di\\x00erent cultures have\\nestablished di\\x00erent ways of approaching these circumstances. Those leaders and\\ncultures who understand them and can adapt to their circumstances will\\nproduce much better outcomes than those who don’t. That is where timeless\\nand universal principles come in.\\nWhile the length of time spent in each of these stages can vary a lot, the\\nevolution through them generally takes 100 years, give or take a lot and with big\\nundulations within the cycle. Like evolution in general, the evolution of internal\\norders occurs in a cyclical way in which one stage typically leads to the nextthrough a progression of stages that repeat and, in the process, evolve to higher\\nlevels of development. For example, Stage 1 (when the new internal order is\\ncreated by new leaders who came to power via a civil war/revolution) normally\\ncomes after Stage 6 (when there is a civil war/revolution, which is the low point\\nin the cycle), which leads to the next stage and so on up to Stage 3 (which is the\\nhigh point in the cycle because there is a lot of peace and prosperity in that\\nstage), which gets overdone in Stages 4 and 5 and so on, leading to the next new\\norder (Stage 1). That happens over and over again in an upward-evolving way.\\nAgain, that archetypical cycle typically takes 100 years, give or take a lot. Within\\neach cycle there are similar, smaller cycles. For example, there is a short-term debt\\ncycle that leads to bubbles and recessions that come along roughly every eight\\nyears, there are political cycles that move political control between the right and\\nthe left that come along with roughly equal frequency, etc. Every country is\\nnow going through them, and many of them are in di\\x00erent stages. For\\nexample, China and India are in very di\\x00erent stages than the United\\nStates and most European countries. Which stages countries are in versus\\nother countries a\\x00ects the relations between countries and is the primary\\ndeterminant of the world order. We will explore all of this in the last\\nchapter of this book. The cycle’s archetypical evolution transpires as\\nshown in the following diagram.\\nThat is the complete internal order cycle. But of course the cycle repeats, with\\nnew leaders replacing the old ones and the whole cycle beginning again. How\\nquickly a nation is able to rebuild and achieve new heights of prosperity depends\\non 1) how severe the civil war/revolution that ended the prior cycle was and 2)how competent the leaders of the new cycle are at establishing the things\\nrequired for success.\\nThese cycles have taken place for as long as there has been recorded\\nhistory (and probably before), so many cycles are linked together, and\\nthey are upward-sloping because of evolutionary gains that are made over\\ntime.\\nTo see this at the country level, let’s look at China. The following chart\\nshows my estimates of China’s a b s o l u t e powers and its \\x00gurative Big\\nCycles going back to around the year 600. This is an ultra-simpli\\x00ed chart\\n(i.e., there were many more dynasties and complexities). I am presenting it in this\\nway so you can see how this evolution transpired from the 30,000-foot level.\\nThe next chart shows China’s r e l a t i v e powers. The di\\x00erences between\\nthe charts are due to the fact that the \\x00rst one shows the absolute level of power\\nwhile the second one shows the level of power relative to other empires.Since di\\x00erent countries are typically in di\\x00erent stages of the cycle\\nand since they take wealth and global political power from each other,\\nsome countries are rising while others are declining, so the whole is less\\nvolatile than any one country. In other words, the di\\x00erences have had a\\ndiversifying e\\x00ect that has made the whole world’s evolution smoother than that\\nof any individual country. That is shown in the next chart, which is an update to\\nthe global real GDP chart I showed you in Chapter 1. This chart is not a\\n\\x00gurative representation. It is literally the best estimate we have of real GDP per\\ncapita. Embedded in this chart are the rises and falls of major empires\\n(particularly the Dutch and the British empires and the Ming and Qing\\ndynasties), numerous wars, and numerous booms and busts, all of which are\\ncalled out. These events don’t show up at the global level because they diversify\\neach other and because they are small relative to the big trends, even though they\\nare huge from the perspective of the people living through them.To reiterate, the \\x00gurative pictures of the archetypical six-stage cycle I just\\npainted are simpli\\x00ed versions of what really happens. I wanted to show you a\\nsimpli\\x00ed version that conveys the essence of the stages and then descend into\\nthe details. While the cycle by and large progresses as I described, it doesn’t\\nalways progress exactly as I described. For example, like the stages of a disease\\n(let’s say Stage 3 cancer), being in one stage doesn’t mean that the progression to\\nthe next stage is inevitable. But it does tell us a lot that is very valuable. As with a\\ndisease, certain symptoms are clearly exhibited that allow one to identify which\\nstage in the cycle one is in, and being in that stage signi\\x00es the risks and ways of\\ntreating the situation that are essential to know and are di\\x00erent from those that\\nexist in di\\x00erent stages. For example, being in Stage 5 means that certain\\nconditions exist that make it more likely that the cycle will progress to Stage 6\\nthan if it were in Stage 4 with Stage 4 conditions. By having clear and objective\\nmarkers to identify which stage each country (or state or city) is in, and by\\nhaving an understanding of the cause/e\\x00ect relationships that produce changes,\\none can better know the range of possibilities and position oneself accordingly,\\nthough one can never get them exactly right.\\nAs an example, we made an index of the number of economic red \\x00ags that\\nhave existed at di\\x00erent times in history, including measures of high inequality,high debt and de\\x00cits, in\\x00ation, and bad growth, to show how indicative they\\nare of subsequent civil wars and revolutions. The following chart shows the\\nestimated likelihood of a civil-war-type con\\x00ict based on the number of red \\x00ags.\\nBased on what we have seen in the past, we estimate that when there are 60–80\\npercent of the red \\x00ags present, there is around a 1-in-6 chance of severe internal\\ncon\\x00ict. When lots of these conditions are in place (greater than 80 percent)\\nthere is around a 1-in-3 chance of a civil war or revolution—so not very probable\\nbut still too probable for comfort. The US is in the 60–80 percent bucket today.\\n2\\nWhile I won’t take you through all of the factors in each stage and their\\nvarious con\\x00gurations, I will outline the forces and milestones to pay most\\nattention to in each stage, with a special emphasis on the current state of\\ndisorder in the United States and how things are progressing.\\nDelving int o the Six Stages of the Cy cle\\nWe will now delve into what the archetypical six stages look like in greater detail\\nso we can identify them easily when we see them and so we can better imagine\\nwhat might come next.\\nStage 1: When the New Or der Begins and the New Leadership\\nConsolidates P ower\\nTo \\x00ght a civil war or to have a revolution—even a peaceful one—is to\\nhave a great con\\x00ict in which one side wins and the other side loses andthe country su\\x00ers damages. Stage 1 is what follows the war; it is a time\\nwhen the winners gain control and the losers must submit. While the\\nwinners were strong enough to win, at this \\x00rst stage of the new order,\\nthey must also be wise enough to consolidate power and rebuild the\\ncountry.\\nAfter winning power, the new leaders typically mop up the remaining\\nopposition and \\x00ght among themselves for power. In fact, one might say\\nthat revolutions typically come in two parts—the \\x00rst part is the \\x00ght to\\nbring down the established leaders and systems, and the second part is\\nthe \\x00ght to remove those who were loyal to the former leaders and the\\n\\x00ght for power among those who won. I will call the second part\\n“purges” and touch on them in this section.\\nThese consolidation of power/purge periods range widely in form and\\nseverity, depending on the degrees of con\\x00ict between the new leaders and their\\nopposition, the amount of con\\x00ict between the new leaders themselves, and the\\nlevels of development of the various government departments and bureaucracies\\nthat they are inheriting.\\nThis is the stage when, in some cases, the remaining opposition is killed or\\nimprisoned so that the new leaders are assured that their enemies won’t come\\nback \\x00ghting. It is also when those revolutionaries who were on the winning side\\nof the revolution \\x00ght against each other for power.\\nThis stage has happened after virtually all civil wars/revolutions. Its intensity\\nvaries, usually in proportion to the intensity of the civil war/revolution that\\npreceded this stage. At its worst, this post-revolution \\x00ghting to consolidate\\npower produced some of the most brutal periods in a given country’s history—\\ne.g., the post-1789 French Revolution period called the Reign of Terror, the\\npost-1917 Russian Revolution period called the Red Terror, the post-1949\\nChinese Civil War period called the Anti-Rightist Campaign, etc. In some cases\\nthese purges happened a single time right after the revolution (e.g., the Reign of\\nTerror), while in other cases they came and went episodically over decades (e.g.,\\nChina’s Cultural Revolution happened 17 years after the Chinese Communist\\nParty came to power). These purges are done to consolidate power and persecute\\nperceived ideological enemies or enemies of the state, and they are sometimesmore brutal than the revolution itself. At their best, and if conditions allow\\nbecause the basic system and respect for it is maintained, they’re like the period\\nafter the US Civil War or during the peaceful Roosevelt revolution of the 1930s.\\nDuring this stage the leaders who do best are “consolidators of\\npower.” They typically have qualities similar to those who did best in the\\nrevolution in the prior stage—as they are strong, smart \\x00ghters who are willing\\nand able to win at all costs. But in this stage they have to be much more\\npolitically astute because the enemies are much less apparent. Tang Emperor\\nTaizong and Rome’s Caesar Augustus excelled at this stage. More recently,\\nleaders such as the US Founding Fathers, France’s Napoleon, and Germany’s\\nOtto von Bismarck also exemplify how to e\\x00ectively move from the war period\\nto the rebuilding period.\\nThis stage is over when the new authorities are clear and everyone is sick of\\nthe \\x00ghting and is well into the rebuilding.\\nStage 2: When Resour ce-Allocation Systems and Go vernment\\nBureaucr acies Ar e Built and Reﬁned\\nI call this phase “early prosperity” because it is typically the beginning of\\na peaceful and prosperous period.\\nAfter the new leaders have torn down the old order and consolidated power,\\nor overlapping with that time, the new leaders have to start building a new\\nsystem to better allocate resources. This is the stage when system and institution\\nbuilding are of paramount importance. What is required is designing and\\ncreating a system (order) that leads to people rowing in the same direction in\\npursuit of similar goals, with respect for rules and laws, and putting together an\\ne\\x00ective resource-allocation system that leads to rapidly improving productivity\\nthat bene\\x00ts most people. This redesigning and rebuilding period has to be done\\neven after lost wars because rebuilding still must occur. Examples of countries\\nbeing in this stage include the United States in the 15 years after it declared\\nindependence in 1776; the early Napoleonic era immediately after Napoleon\\ngrabbed power in a coup at the end of the French Revolution in 1799; the early\\nJapanese Meiji Restoration period immediately after the political revolution in1868; the post-war periods in Japan, Germany, and most countries in the late\\n1940s through most of the 1950s; the post-civil war period in China; and Russia\\nafter the breakup of the Soviet Union.\\nA timeless and universal principle to keep in mind during this stage is that \\n to\\nbe successful the system has to produce prosperity for most people, especially the large\\nmiddle class . As Aristotle conveyed in Politics: “Those states are likely to be well-\\nadministered in which the middle class is large, and stronger if possible than\\nboth the other classes… where the middle class is large, there are least likely to be\\nfactions and dissensions… For when there is no middle class, and the poor are\\nexcessive in number, troubles arise, and the state soon comes to an end.”\\nThe leaders who are best during this stage are typically very di\\x00erent\\nfrom those who succeeded in Stages 6 and 1. I call them “civil engineers.”\\nWhile they need to be smart, and ideally they are still strong and\\ninspirational, above all else they need to be able to design and build the\\nsystem that is productive for most people, or they need to have people\\nworking for them who can do that. The di\\x00erent qualities of leaders that are\\nrequired to succeed in the revolutionary Stages 6 and 1 and those that are\\nrequired in this rebuilding administrative Stage 2 are exempli\\x00ed by Winston\\nChurchill and Mao being great “inspirational generals” and lousy “civil\\nengineers.” Examples of great leaders at this stage include Konrad Adenauer in\\nGermany, Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, and Deng Xiaoping in China, who came\\nto power after wars and built systems that produced prosperity well beyond their\\nlifetimes.\\nThe most extraordinary leaders are those who took their countries\\nthrough Stages 6, 1, and 2—i.e., through the civil war/revolution,\\nthrough the consolidation of power, and through the building of the\\ninstitutions and systems that worked fabulously for a long time after\\nthem—and did it at scale. The best ever probably were Tang Taizong (one of\\nthe revolutionary founders of the Tang Dynasty in China in the 600s, which was\\nfollowed by about a century and a half of peace and prosperity that led China to\\nbecome the world’s largest and strongest country); Caesar Augustus (who\\nbecame the \\x00rst emperor of Rome in 27 BCE and began roughly 200 years of\\nrelative peace and prosperity, in which Rome became the world’s largest empire);and Genghis Khan (who founded and led the Mongol Empire starting in 1206,\\nwhich was followed by over a century of prosperity when it became the world’s\\nlargest and strongest empire, though failure to establish a sustainable succession\\nproduced civil wars, including shortly after his death).\\nThis sequence of rebuilding happens all the time in varying degrees\\ndepending on the amount of change that is warranted. In some cases it comes\\nafter brutal revolutions when there needs to be a rebuilding of nearly everything,\\nand in other cases it comes when the institutions and systems that are there just\\nneed to be modi\\x00ed to suit the new leader.\\nStage 3: When Ther e Is P eace and Pr osperity\\nI also call this phase “mid-prosperity.” It is the sweet spot of the internal\\norder cycle. It is when people have an abundance of opportunity to be\\nproductive, are excited about it, work well together, produce a lot, get\\nrich, and are admired for being successful. In this stage conditions are\\nimproving for almost everyone so most of the next generation is better o\\x00 than\\nmost of the prior generation, so there is broad optimism and excitement about\\nthe future. History shows us that, when done well, there is wide and almost\\nequal access to education and merit-based placements in jobs. This draws on the\\nwidest possible range of the population to access talent and yields a system that\\nmost people believe is fair. Successful entrepreneurs, inventors, and adventurers\\nproduce new ideas and take their societies to new places and become the heroes\\nwho others aspire to be like because of how they come up with revolutionary\\nnew ideas, make people’s lives better, and are rewarded for it. Debt growth fuels\\nproductivity and in turn real income growth, which makes debts easy to service\\nand provides excess pro\\x00ts that make equity returns excellent. Incomes exceed\\nexpenses and savings exceed liabilities with the savings \\x00nancing investment in\\nthe future. Stage 3 is an exciting period that has a lot of creativity, productivity,\\nand energy.\\nExamples of this period include most of the Victorian Era in Britain\\n(covering much of the 19th century, marked by Second Industrial Revolution\\ninventions producing a rapid increase in prosperity); the German Empire in thelate 1800s (with rapid industrialization, technological innovation, and a quickly\\nstrengthening military); and the 1960s in the United States. For example, the\\nmoon shot project exempli\\x00ed the shared mission. The whole country cheered\\nand was brought closer together when the lunar landing happened.\\nThis is the time for the “inspirational visionary” who can a) imagine\\nand convey an exciting picture of a future that never existed before, b)\\nactually build that future out, and then c) use the prosperity earned to\\nbroaden the inclusiveness of it and to invest in the future. They do this\\nwhile d) maintaining sound \\x00nances and e) pursuing excellent\\ninternational relations, so that they protect or expand their empires\\nwithout any \\x00nancially or socially debilitating wars. Examples include:\\nIn the British Empire’s Victorian Age in the mid-to-late 1800s, Prime\\nMinister William Gladstone simultaneously maintained high levels of\\nproductivity, imposed strict budget controls that led to strong \\x00nances,\\nand supported the general population so much that he was known as “The\\nPeople’s William.” He also ran a peaceful and prosperous foreign policy.\\nIn the German Empire in the late 1800s, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck\\nunited the disparate populations of 39 di\\x00erent states and people of\\ndi\\x00erent religions to build Germany as a country and an economic\\npowerhouse. Under him Germany had an economic boom with sound\\n\\x00nances while brilliantly navigating international relations so it bene\\x00ted\\ninternally and avoided debilitating major wars.\\nPrime Minister Lee Kuan Yew successfully took Singapore through these\\nstages by running the country as prime minister from 1959 to 1990 and\\nmentoring until his death in 2015. He created the principles and shaped\\nthe culture to be successful long after him and avoided wars without losing\\npower.\\nIn the post-war US, John F. Kennedy in his 34 short months as president\\nfrom January 20, 1961, to November 22, 1963, inspired the country to go\\nto the moon, advanced the civil rights movement, undertook the War on\\nPoverty with Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and kept the United Statesout of major wars while simultaneously strongly containing opposition to\\nthe US Empire.\\nIn China, Deng Xiaoping transitioned a weak and ine\\x00cient communist\\nsystem to a highly productive state capitalist system, quickly changing the\\nnation’s psychology to make these changes with sayings such as “it is\\nglorious to be rich” and “it doesn’t matter whether the cat is black or white\\nas long as it catches mice”; built China’s economy and \\x00nances to be very\\nstrong; enormously improved the education and quality of life of most\\npeople; dramatically increased life expectancies and reduced poverty rates;\\nsuccessfully led China through internal political con\\x00icts; and strictly\\nmaintained China’s sovereignty while avoiding major external con\\x00icts.\\nThe longer countries stay in this stage, the longer their good times last.\\nDuring this stage the developments to pay attention to that re\\x00ect the\\nbig risks that naturally develop and undermine the self-sustaining good\\nresults are the widenings of the opportunity, income, wealth, and values\\ngaps accompanied by bad and unfair conditions for the majority,\\nluxurious and unfairly privileged positions for the elites, declining\\nproductivity, and bad \\x00nances in which excess debts are created. The\\ngreat empires and great dynasties that were able to sustain themselves\\nstayed in Stage 3 by avoiding these risks. The failure to avoid these risks leads\\nto Stage 4, which is a period of excesses. This is the stage in which the\\ntemptation to do everything (and borrow money to do it) can lead to the brink\\nof con\\x00ict.\\nStage 4: A P eriod of Ex cesses\\nI also call this the “bubble prosperity phase.” I will describe it brie\\x00y because\\nwe touched on these elements before. Classically:\\nThere is the rapidly increasing debt-\\x00nanced purchases of goods, services,\\nand investment assets, so debt growth outpaces the capacity of future cash\\n\\x00ows to service the debts. So bubbles are created. These debt-\\x00nancedpurchases emerge because investors, business leaders, \\x00nancial\\nintermediaries, individuals, and policy makers tend to assume that the\\nfuture will be like the past so they bet heavily on the trends continuing.\\nThey mistakenly believe that investments that have gone up a lot are good\\nrather than expensive so they borrow money to buy them, which drives up\\ntheir prices, which reinforces this bubble process. That is because as their\\nassets go up in value their net worth and spending-to-income level rise,\\nwhich increases their borrowing capacity, which supports the leveraging-up\\nprocess, and so the spiral goes until the bubbles burst. Japan in 1988–90,\\nthe US in 1929, the US in 2006–07, and Brazil and most other Latin\\nAmerican commodity producers in 1977–79 are classic examples.\\nThere is a shift in the spending of money and time to more on\\nconsumption and luxury goods and less on pro\\x00table investments. The\\nreduced level of investments in infrastructure, capital goods, and R&D\\nslows the country’s productivity gains and leads its cities and infrastructure\\nto become older and less e\\x00cient.\\nThere is a lot of spending on the military at this stage to expand and\\nprotect global interests, especially if the country is a leading global power.\\nThe country’s balance of payments positions deteriorate, re\\x00ecting its\\nincreased borrowing and reduced competitiveness. If the country is a\\nreserve currency country, this borrowing is made easy as the result of non-\\nreserve currency country savers having a preference to save in/lend to the\\nreserve currency.\\nWealth and opportunity gaps are large and resentments between classes\\nemerge.\\nDuring this phase, the archetypical best leader is the “well-grounded,\\ndisciplined leader” who understands and conveys sound fundamental\\nbehaviors that yield productivity and sound \\x00nances and creates\\nrestraints when the crowd wants to overdo things. These leaders are the\\nones who lead the country to continue to reinvest a signi\\x00cant amount of\\ntheir earnings and their time into being productive when they become\\nricher. As mentioned, Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore,ensured that his country and fellow citizens had the culture to become well-\\neducated, disciplined, and of strong character even after becoming successful\\nand rich. However, these leaders are few and far between because \\x00ghting the\\nebullience of the masses is very unpopular. In almost all cases, after becoming\\nrich, the country (and its leaders) become decadent, overspend, borrow to\\n\\x00nance excess consumption, and lose competitiveness. This period of decline is\\nexempli\\x00ed by decadent leaders such as the notorious Emperor Nero (who used\\na citywide \\x00re in Rome to con\\x00scate land to build an expansive palace), Louis\\nXIV (who expanded the Palace of Versailles while productivity fell and people\\nendured hardships at the height of his power), and the Ming Dynasty’s Wanli\\nEmperor (who withdrew from actively governing and focused on the\\nconstruction of his own immense tomb).\\nStage 5: When Ther e Are Bad Financial Conditions and Intense\\nConﬂict\\nThe most important in\\x00uence that transpires in a Big Cycle is that of debt,\\nmoney, and economic activity. Because I covered that cycle comprehensively in\\nChapters 3 and 4, I won’t explain it here in detail. But to understand Stage 5,\\nyou need to know that it follows Stage 3, in which there is peace and prosperity\\nand favorable debt and credit conditions, and Stage 4, in which excess and\\ndecadence begin to bring about worse conditions. This process culminates in the\\nmost di\\x00cult and painful stage—Stage 6—w hen the entity runs out of money\\nand there is typically terrible con\\x00ict in the form of revolution or civil war. Stage\\n5 is the period during which the interclass tensions that go along with worsening\\n\\x00nancial conditions come to a head. How di\\x00erent leaders, policy makers, and\\ngroups of people deal with con\\x00ict has a major impact on whether the country\\nwill undergo the needed changes peacefully or violently.\\nYou can see signs of this happening now in a number of countries. Those that\\nhave adequate \\x00nancial conditions (i.e., have incomes that are greater than their\\nexpenses and assets that are greater than their liabilities) are in relatively good\\nshape. Those that do not are in relatively bad shape. They want money from theothers. The problem is that there are many more who are in bad shape relative to\\nthose that are in good shape.\\nYou can also see that these di\\x00erent conditions are big drivers of the\\ndi\\x00erences in what is now happening to most aspects of these countries, states,\\ncities, companies, and people—e.g., their education, healthcare, infrastructure,\\nand well-being. You can also see big cultural di\\x00erences in how countries\\napproach their stressful conditions, with some approaching them more\\nharmoniously than others who are more inclined to \\x00ght.\\nBecause Stage 5 is such a pivotal stage in the internal cycle and because it’s the\\nstage that many countries, most importantly the US, are now in, I will devote\\nsome time to going through the cause/e\\x00ect relationships at play during it and\\nthe key indicators to watch in examining its progression. Then I will turn more\\nspeci\\x00cally to where the United States stands.\\nThe Classic Toxic Mix\\n The classic toxic mix of forces that brings about big internal conﬂicts consi sts of 1) the\\ncountr y and the people in the countr y (or state or city) being in bad ﬁnancial shape (e.g.,\\nhaving big debt and non-debt obligations), 2) large income, wealth, and values gaps within\\nthat entity , and 3) a se vere negativ e economic shock.\\nThat con\\x00uence typically brings about disorder, con\\x00ict, and sometimes civil\\nwars. The economic shock can come about for many reasons, including \\x00nancial\\nbubbles that burst, acts of nature (such as pandemics, droughts, and \\x00oods), and\\nwars. It creates a \\x00nancial stress test. The \\x00nancial conditions (as measured by\\nincomes relative to expenses and assets relative to liabilities) that exist at the time\\nof the stress test are the shock absorbers. The sizes of the gaps in incomes,\\nwealth, and values are the degrees of fragility of the system. When the \\x00nancial\\nproblems occur, they typically \\x00rst hit the private sector and then the public\\nsector. Because governments will never let the private sector’s \\x00nancial problems\\nsink the entire system, it is the government’s \\x00nancial condition that matters\\nmost. When the government runs out of buying power, there is a collapse. But\\non the way to a collapse there is a lot of \\x00ghting for money and political power.\\nFrom studying 50-plus civil wars and revolutions, it became clear that the\\nsingle most reliable leading indicator of civil war or revolution is bankruptgovernment \\x00nances combined with big wealth gaps. That is because when the\\ngovernment lacks \\x00nancial power, it can’t \\x00nancially save those entities in the\\nprivate sector that the government needs to save to keep the system running (as\\nmost governments, led by the United States, did at the end of 2008), it can’t buy\\nwhat it needs, and it can’t pay people to do what it needs them to do. It is out of\\npower.\\nA classic marker of being in Stage 5 and a leading indicator of the loss\\nof borrowing and spending power, which is one of the triggers for going\\ninto Stage 6, is that the government has large de\\x00cits that are creating\\nmore debt to be sold than buyers other than the government’s own\\ncentral bank are willing to buy. That leading indicator is turned on when\\ngovernments that can’t print money have to raise taxes and cut spending,\\nor when those that can print money print a lot of it and buy a lot of\\ngovernment debt. To be more speci\\x00c, when the government runs out of\\nmoney (by running a big de\\x00cit, having large debts, and not having access to\\nadequate credit), it has limited options. It can either raise taxes and cut spending\\na lot or print a lot of money, which depreciates its value. Those governments\\nthat have the option to print money always do so because that is the much less\\npainful path, but it leads investors to run out of the money and debt that is\\nbeing printed. Those governments that can’t print money have to raise taxes and\\ncut spending, which drives those with money to run out of the country (or state\\nor city) because paying more taxes and losing services is intolerable. If these\\nentities that can’t print money have large wealth gaps among their constituents,\\nthese moves typically lead to some form of civil war/revolution.3\\nAt the time of this writing, this late-cycle debt dynamic is now playing out in\\nthe United States at both the state and federal levels, with the main di\\x00erence\\nbetween them being that state governments can’t print money to pay their debts\\nwhile the federal government can. The federal government and many state and\\ncity governments have large de\\x00cits, large debts, and large wealth gaps, and the\\ncentral bank (the Federal Reserve) has the power to print money. So, at the time\\nof this writing, the central bank is printing a lot of money and buying a lot of\\nfederal government debt, which \\x00nances the government spending that is much\\nbigger than the federal government’s intake. That has helped the federalgovernment and those it is trying to help, though it has also cost those who are\\nholding dollars and dollar debt a lot in real purchasing power.\\n Those places (cities, states, and countries) that have the largest wealth gaps, the\\nlargest debts, and the worst declines in incomes are most likely to have the greatest\\nconﬂicts . Interestingly, those states and cities in the US that have the highest per\\ncapita income and wealth levels tend to be the states and cities that are the most\\nindebted and have the largest wealth gaps—e.g., cities like San Francisco,\\nChicago, and New York City and states like Connecticut, Illinois,\\nMassachusetts, New York, and New Jersey.\\nFacing these conditions, expenditures have to be cut or more money\\nhas to be raised in some way. The next question becomes who will pay to\\n\\x00x them, the “haves” or the “have-nots”? Obviously, it can’t be the have-\\nnots. Expenditure cuts are most intolerable for those who are poorest, so there\\nneeds to be more taxation of people who can a\\x00ord to pay more and there is a\\nheightened risk of some form of civil war or revolution. But when the haves\\nrealize that they will be taxed to pay for debt service and to reduce the\\nde\\x00cits, they typically leave, causing the hollowing-out process. This is\\ncurrently motivating movements from some states to others in the US. If bad\\neconomic conditions occur, that hastens the process. These circumstances\\nlargely drive the tax cycle.\\n History shows that raising taxes and cutting spending when there are large wealth\\ngaps and bad econo mic conditions, more than anything else, has been a leading indicat or of\\ncivil wars  or revolutions of some type. To be clear they don’t have to be violent,\\nthough they can be.\\nI see these cycles transpiring in my personal interactions. For example, I live in\\nthe state of Connecticut, which has the highest per capita income in the country,\\nthe largest wealth gap and income gap in the country, and one of the largest per\\ncapita debt and unfunded pension obligations in the country. I see how the\\nhaves and the have-nots are focused on their own lives and spend little time\\nworrying about the other because they don’t have much contact. I have\\nwindows into what the lives of both the haves and the have-nots are like because\\nI have contact with the people in our community of haves and because the work\\nmy wife does to help disengaged and disconnected high school students indisadvantaged communities brings her into contact with people who live in the\\ncommunities of the have-nots. I see how terrible the conditions are in those\\nhave-not communities and how the haves (who appear rich and decadent to the\\nhave-nots) don’t feel rich. I see how they are all focused on their own struggles—\\nwith the haves struggling with work/life balance, making sure their kids are well-\\neducated, etc., and the have-nots struggling with \\x00nding income, food security,\\navoiding violence, trying to get their kids a quality education, etc.4\\nI see how both groups are more likely to have critical, stereotypical\\nimpressions of each other that make them more inclined to dislike each other\\nthan to view themselves empathetically as members of one community in which\\nthey should help each other. I see how di\\x00cult it can be to help each other\\nbecause of these stereotypes and because the haves don’t feel that they have more\\nthan enough or that the have-nots deserve their \\x00nancial support, and I fear\\nwhat the future might hold because of the existing circumstances and how they\\nare likely to worsen. I have seen close up how COVID-in\\x00icted health and\\nbudget shocks have brought to the surface the terrible conditions of the have-\\nnots and are worsening the \\x00nancial gaps that could bring about the classic toxic\\nmix dynamic.\\n Averages don’t matter as much as the number of people who are suffering and their\\npower . Those who favor policies that are good for the whole—e.g., free trade,\\nglobalization, advances in technology that replace people—w ithout thinking\\nabout what happens if the whole is not divided in a way that bene\\x00ts most\\npeople are missing the fact that the whole is at risk. \\n To have peace and prosperity , a\\nsociety must have productivity that beneﬁts most people.  Do you think we have this\\ntoday?\\nWhat does history show as the path that bankrupt governments can follow to\\nraise productivity that bene\\x00ts most people? It shows that restructuring and/or\\ndevaluing enough of the previously created debt and non-debt obligations helps\\na lot. That is classic in Stages 5 and 6. Once the restructuring or devaluation\\nreduces the debt burdens, which is typically painful at the time, the reduced debt\\nburdens allow for a rebuilding.\\n An essential ingredient for success is that the debt and mone y that are created are\\nused to produce productivity gains and favorable returns on investment, rather than justbeing given away without yielding productivity and income gains. If it is given away without\\nyielding these gains, the mone y will be devalued to the point that it won’t leave the\\ngovernment or any one else with much buying power .\\n History shows that lending and spending on items that produce broad-based\\nproductivity gains and returns on investment that exceed the borrowing costs result in living\\nstandar ds rising with debts being paid off, so these are good policies.  If the amount of\\nmoney being lent to \\x00nance the debt is inadequate, it is perfectly \\x00ne for the\\ncentral bank to print the money and be the lender of last resort as long as the\\nmoney is invested to have a return that is large enough to service the debt.\\nHistory shows and logic dictates that investing well in education at all levels\\n(including job training), infrastructure, and research that yields productive\\ndiscoveries works very well. For example, big education and infrastructure\\nprograms have paid o\\x00 nearly all the time (e.g., in the Tang Dynasty and many\\nother Chinese dynasties, in the Roman Empire, in the Umayyad Caliphate, in\\nthe Mughal Empire in India, in Japan’s Meiji Restoration, and in China’s\\neducational development programs over the last couple of decades), though they\\nhave long lead times. In fact, improvements in education and infrastructure,\\neven those \\x00nanced by debt, were essential ingredients behind the rises of\\nvirtually all empires, and declines in the quality of these investments were almost\\nalways ingredients behind empires’ declines. If done well, these interventions can\\nmore than counterbalance the classic toxic mix.\\nThe classic toxic mix is usually accompanied by other problems. The more of\\nthe following conditions that are in place, the higher the probability of having a\\nsevere con\\x00ict like a civil war or revolution.\\n+ Decadence\\nWhile early in the cycle there is typically more spending of time and money on\\nproductive things, later in the cycle time and money go more toward indulgent\\nthings (e.g., the \\x00ner things, like expensive residences, art, jewelry, and clothes).\\nThis begins in Stage 4 when such spending is fashionable, but by Stage 5 it\\nbegins to appear grotesque. Often that decadent spending is debt-\\x00nanced,\\nwhich worsens the \\x00nancial conditions. The change in psychology that typically\\ngoes along with these changes is understandable. The haves feel that they haveearned their money so they can spend it on luxuries if they like, while the have-\\nnots view such spending at the same time they are su\\x00ering as unfair and sel\\x00sh.\\nBesides increasing resentments, decadent spending (as distinct from saving and\\ninvesting) reduces productivity. \\n What a society spends mone y on matters. When it\\nspends on investme nt items that yield productivity and income gains, it mak es for a better\\nfutur e than when it spends on consumption items that don ’t raise pr oductivity and income.\\n+ Bureaucracy\\n While early in the internal order cycle bureaucr acy is low, it is high late in the cycle, which\\nmak es sensible and needed decision making more diﬃcult.  That is because things tend\\nto get more complex as they develop until they reach the point where even\\nobviously good things can’t be done—necessitating revolutionary changes. In a\\nlegal and contract-based system (which has many bene\\x00ts), this can become a\\nproblem because the law can stand in the way of doing obviously good things. I\\nwill give you an example that I’m close to because my wife and I care about it.\\nBecause the US Constitution doesn’t make education a federal government\\nresponsibility, it has predominantly been a state and local responsibility with\\nschool funding coming from revenue raised by local taxes in cities and towns.\\nThough it varies from state to state, typically those children in richer towns in\\nricher states receive a much better education than those in poorer towns in\\npoorer states. This is obviously unfair and unproductive even though most\\npeople agree that children should have equal opportunities in education. But\\nbecause this structure is so ingrained in our political system, it is nearly\\nimpossible to \\x00x without a revolutionary reinvention of how we approach it.\\nThere are more examples of the bureaucracy standing in the way of doing\\nsensible, productive things than I have time and space to convey here. It is now a\\nbig problem in America.\\n+ Populism and Extremism\\nOut of disorder and discontent come leaders who have strong\\npersonalities, are anti-elitist, and claim to \\x00ght for the common man.\\nThey are called populists. Populism is a political and social phenomenonthat appeals to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are not\\nbeing addressed by the elites. It typically develops when there are wealth\\nand opportunity gaps, perceived cultural threats from those with\\ndi\\x00erent values both inside and outside the country, and “establishment\\nelites” in positions of power who are not working e\\x00ectively for most\\npeople. Populists come into power when these conditions create anger among\\nordinary people who want those with political power to be \\x00ghters for them.\\nPopulists can be of the right or of the left, are much more extreme than\\nmoderates, and tend to appeal to the emotions of ordinary people. They are\\ntypically confrontational rather than collaborative and exclusive rather than\\ninclusive. This leads to a lot of \\x00ghting between populists of the left and\\npopulists of the right over irreconcilable di\\x00erences. The extremity of the\\nrevolution that occurs under them varies. For example, in the 1930s, populism\\nof the left took the form of communism and that of the right took the form of\\nfascism while nonviolent revolutionary changes took place in the US and the\\nUK. More recently, in the United States, the election of Donald Trump in 2016\\nwas a move to populism of the right while the popularity of Bernie Sanders,\\nElizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez re\\x00ects the popularity of\\npopulism of the left. There are increased political movements toward populism\\nin a number of countries. It could be said that the election of Joe Biden re\\x00ects a\\ndesire for less extremism and more moderation, though time will tell.\\nWatch populism and polarization as markers. The more that populism\\nand polarization exist, the further along a nation is in Stage 5, and the\\ncloser it is to civil war and revolution. In Stage 5, moderates become the\\nminority. In Stage 6, they cease to exist.\\n+ Class Warfare\\nIn Stage 5, class warfare intensi\\x00es. That is because, as a rule, \\n during times of\\nincreased hardship  and conﬂict there is an increased inclination to look at people in\\nstereotypical ways as members of one or more classes and to look at these classes as\\neither being enemies or allies.  In Stage 5, this begins to become much more\\napparent. In Stage 6, it becomes dangerous.A classic marker in Stage 5 that increases in Stage 6 is the\\ndemonization of those in other classes, which typically produces one or\\nmore scapegoat classes who are commonly believed to be the source of the\\nproblems. This leads to a drive to exclude, imprison, or destroy them,\\nwhich happens in Stage 6. Ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups are often\\ndemonized. The most classic, horri\\x00c example of this comes from the Nazi’s\\ntreatment of Jews, who were blamed and persecuted for virtually all of\\nGermany’s problems. Chinese minorities living in non-Chinese countries have\\nbeen demonized and scapegoated during periods of economic and social stress.\\nIn the UK, Catholics were demonized and scapegoated in numerous stressful\\nperiods, such as the Glorious Revolution and the English Civil War. Rich\\ncapitalists are commonly demonized, especially those who are viewed to be\\nmaking their money at the expense of the poor. Demonizing and scapegoating\\nare a classic symptom and problem that we must keep an eye on.\\n+ The Loss of Truth in the Public Domain\\nNot knowing what is true because of distortions in the media and\\npropaganda increases as people become more polarized, emotional, and\\npolitically motivated.\\nIn Stage 5, those who are \\x00ghting typically work with those in the\\nmedia to manipulate people’s emotions to gain support and to destroy\\nthe opposition. In other words, media folks of the left join with others of the\\nleft and media folks of the right join with others of the right in the dirty \\x00ght.\\nThe media goes wild like vigilantes: people are commonly attacked and\\nessentially tried and found guilty in the media, and they have their lives ruined\\nwithout a judge and jury. A common move among 1930s populists of the left\\n(communists) and of the right (fascists) was to take control of the media and\\nestablish “ministers of propaganda” to guide them. The media they produced\\nwas explicitly aimed at turning the population against the groups that the\\ngovernments considered “enemies of the state.” The government of the\\ndemocratically run United Kingdom created a “Ministry of Information”\\nduring World War I and World War II to spread government propaganda, and\\nleading newspaper publishers were elevated by the government if they did whatthe government wanted them to do to win the propaganda war5 or were vili\\x00ed\\nand su\\x00ered if they didn’t cooperate. Revolutionaries did the same distorting of\\nthe truth in all sorts of publications. During the French Revolution, newspapers\\nrun by revolutionaries pushed anti-monarchist and anti-religious sentiment, but\\nwhen those revolutionaries attained power, they shut down dissenting\\nnewspapers during the Reign of Terror. During times of great wealth gaps and\\npopulist thinking, stories that bring down elites are popular and lucrative,\\nespecially those that bring down left-leaning elites in right-leaning media outlets\\nand those that bring down right-leaning elites in left-leaning media outlets.\\nHistory shows that signi\\x00cant increases in these activities are a problem that is\\ntypical of Stage 5, and that when combined with the ability to in\\x00ict other\\npunishments, the media becomes a powerful weapon.\\nIt is well-recognized this is happening at the time of this writing. The\\nperceived truth in media, both traditional and social, is lower than at any\\nother time in our lifetimes. For example, a 2019 Gallup poll found that\\nonly 13 percent of Americans surveyed have “a great deal” of trust in the\\nmedia and only 41 percent of those surveyed have either a “fair” or “great\\ndeal” of trust in the media. That compares with 72 percent who trusted\\nthe media in 1976. This is not just a fringe media problem; it is a mainstream\\nmedia problem and a problem for our whole society. The dramatically decreased\\ntrustworthiness has even plagued former icons of journalistic trust such as The\\nWall Street Journal and The New York Times, which have seen their trust ratings\\nplunge. In addition to being politically motivated, sensationalistic stories have\\nbecome commercially rewarding at a time when the media business is in\\n\\x00nancial trouble. Most of the media folks I speak with share my concerns,\\nthough they typically won’t share them openly. Still, in re\\x00ecting on the\\nproblem, Martin Baron, then executive editor of The Washington Post, said, “If\\nyou have a society where people can’t agree on the basic facts, how do you have a\\nfunctioning democracy?” This dynamic is impeding free speech because people\\nare afraid to speak up because of how they will be attacked in both traditional\\nand social media by distortions that are meant to bring them down.\\nEven very capable and powerful people are now too afraid of the\\nmedia to speak up about important matters or run for public o\\x00ce. Sincemost high-pro\\x00le people are torn down, most everyone I speak with agrees that\\nit is dangerous to be a high-pro\\x00le, vocal person who \\x00ghts for truth and justice,\\nespecially if one o\\x00ends people who are inclined to use the media to \\x00ght.\\nThough not discussed in public because of fears of media reprisals, this issue is\\ncontinuously discussed in private. For example, during a lunch I had not long\\nago with a general who had held a very high political position and had just left\\ngovernment service, we explored what he would do next. I asked him what he\\nwas most passionate about. He said, “Of course helping my country.” I asked\\nhim whether he would consider running for elected o\\x00ce, and he explained that\\nwhile he was willing to die for his country he couldn’t bring himself to run for\\npublic o\\x00ce because of how enemies would use the media and social media to\\nmake up lies to harm him and his family. This general and almost everyone I\\nknow who we should listen to are afraid to speak openly because they fear that\\nattacks by extremists who oppose them will be enabled and ampli\\x00ed by the\\nsensationalistic media. Many of my friends tell me that I’m crazy to speak so\\nopenly about controversial things such as those covered in this book because it is\\ninevitable that some people or groups will try to take me down via the media. I\\nthink they are probably right, but I won’t let the risks dissuade me.6\\n+ Rule-Following Fades and Raw Fighting Begins\\n When the causes that people are passionately behind are more impor tant to them than the\\nsystem for making decisions, the syste m is in jeopar dy. Rules and laws work only when they\\nare crystal clear and most people value  working within them enough that they are willing to\\ncompr omise in order to mak e them work well.  If both of these are less than excellent,\\nthe legal system is in jeopardy. If the competing parties are unwilling to try to be\\nreasonable with each other and to make decisions civilly in pursuit of the well-\\nbeing of the whole, which will require them to give up things that they want and\\nmight win in a \\x00ght, there will be a sort of civil war that will test the relative\\npowers of the relevant parties. In this stage, winning at all costs is the game and\\nplaying dirty is the norm. Late in Stage 5 is when reason is abandoned in favor of\\npassion. \\n When winning becomes the only thing that matters, unethical ﬁghting becomes\\nprogressiv ely more forceful in self-r einforcing ways. When everyone has causes that theyare ﬁghting for and no one can agree on anything, the system is on the brink of civil\\nwar/r evolution.\\nThis typically happens in a couple of ways:\\nLate in Stage 5 it is common for the legal and police systems to be\\nused as political weapons by those who can control them. Also\\nprivate police systems form—e.g., thugs who beat people up and\\ntake their assets, and bodyguards to protect people from these\\nthings happening to them. For instance, the Nazi party formed a\\nparamilitary wing before it came to power that then became an o\\x00cial\\nforce when the Nazis were in power. The short-lived British Union of\\nFascists in the 1930s and the Ku Klux Klan in the US were e\\x00ectively\\nparamilitary groups as well. Such cases are quite normal, so view their\\ndevelopment as a marker of moving to the next stage.\\nLate in Stage 5 there are increasing numbers of protests that become\\nincreasingly violent. Because there is not always a clear line between a\\nhealthy protest and the beginnings of a revolution, leaders in power often\\nstruggle over how to allow protests without giving the perceived freedom\\nto revolt against the system. Leaders must manage these situations well. A\\nclassic dilemma arises when demonstrations start to cross over into\\nrevolution. Both giving the freedom to protest and suppressing protests are\\nrisky paths for leaders, as either path could lead the revolution to get strong\\nenough to topple the system. No system allows people to bring down the\\nsystem—in most, an attempt to do so is treason, typically punishable by\\ndeath. Nonetheless, it is the job of revolutionaries to bring down systems,\\nso governments and revolutionaries test each other to see what the limits\\nare. When broad-based discontent bubbles up and those in power allow it\\nto grow, it can boil over to the point that when they try to put a lid on it, it\\nexplodes. The con\\x00icts in the late part of Stage 5 typically build up to a\\ncrescendo that triggers the violent \\x00ghting that signi\\x00es the transition into\\nwhat historians stamp as o\\x00cial civil war periods, which I am identifying as\\nStage 6 in the Big Cycle. \\n People  dying in the ﬁghting is the mark er that almostcertainly signiﬁes the pr ogression t o the next and mor e violent civil war stage, which\\nwill continue until the winners and losers ar e clearly determined.\\nThat brings me to my next principle: \\n when in doubt, get out—if you don’t want to\\nbe in a civil war or a war, you should get out while the getting is good.  This is typically\\nlate in Stage 5. History has shown that when things get bad, the doors typically\\nclose for people who want to leave. The same is true for investments and money\\nas countries introduce capital controls and other measures during such times.\\n Crossing the line from Stage 5 (when there are very bad ﬁnancial condit ions and\\nintense internal and external conﬂict exist) to Stage 6 (when there is civil war) occurs when\\nthe syste m for resolving disagr eements goes from working to not worki ng. In other\\nwords, it happens when the system is broken beyond repair, people are violent\\nwith each other, and the leadership has lost control.\\nAs you might imagine, it is a much bigger deal to break a system/order and\\nbuild a new one than it is to make revolutionary changes within an existing\\nsystem/order. Though breaking a system/order is more traumatic, it isn’t\\nnecessarily a worse path than operating within a system.\\nDeciding whether to keep and renovate something old that is not working\\nwell or to dispose of it and replace it with something new is never easy, especially\\nwhen the something new is not clearly known and what is being replaced is as\\nimportant as the domestic order. Nonetheless, it happens, though typically it is\\nnot decided on intellectually; it is more often emotionally driven.\\n When one is in Stage 5 (like the US is now), the biggest question is how much the\\nsystem will bend befor e it breaks.  The democratic system, which allows the\\npopulation to do pretty much whatever it decides to do, produces more bending\\nbecause the people can make leadership changes and only have themselves to\\nblame. In this system regime changes can more easily happen in a peaceful way.\\nHowever, the “one person, one vote” democratic process has the drawback of\\nhaving leaders selected via popularity contests by people who are largely not\\ndoing the sort of thoughtful review of capabilities that most organizations\\nwould do when trying to \\x00nd the right person for an important job. Democracy\\nhas also been shown to break down in times of great con\\x00ict.Democracy requires consensus decision making and compromise, which\\nrequires a lot of people who have opposing views to work well with each other\\nwithin the system. That ensures that parties that have signi\\x00cant constituencies\\ncan be represented, but like all big committees of people who have widely\\ndi\\x00erent views (and might even dislike each other), the decision-making system\\ndoes not lend itself to e\\x00cient decision making. \\n The biggest risk to democr acies is\\nthat they produce such fragmented and antagonistic decision making that they can be\\nineff ectiv e, which leads to bad results,  which leads to revolutions led by populist autocrats\\nwho represent large segments of the population who want to have a strong, capable leader\\nget contr ol of the chaos and mak e the countr y work well for them.\\nAlso noteworthy: history has shown that during times of great con\\x00ict\\nfederalist democracies (like the US) typically have con\\x00icts between the states\\nand the central government over their relative powers. That would be a marker\\nto look out for that hasn’t yet arisen much in the US; its happening would\\nsignify the continued progression toward Stage 6.\\nThere are far too many breakdowns of democracies to explore, let alone\\ndescribe. While I looked into a number of them to see the patterns, I haven’t\\nfully mined them, and I’m not going to dive into them here. I will say that the\\nfactors described in the explanations of Stage 5 when taken to the extreme—\\nmost importantly, terrible \\x00nances, decadence, internal strife and disorder,\\nand/or major external con\\x00ict—lead to a dysfunctional set of conditions and a\\n\\x00ght for power led by a strong leader. Archetypical examples include Athens\\nfrom the late 400s to the 300s BCE, the end of the Roman Republic in the\\ncentury or so preceding 27 BCE,7 Germany’s Weimar Republic in the 1920s,\\nand the weak democracies of Italy, Japan, and Spain in the 1920s and 1930s that\\nturned to autocracies of the right (fascism) to bring order to the chaos.\\n Different stages r equir e diff erent types of leaders t o get the best r esults.  Stage 5 is a\\njuncture in which one path could lead to civil war/revolution and the\\nother could lead to peaceful and, ideally, prosperous coexistence.\\nObviously the peaceful and prosperous path is the ideal path, but it is the much\\nmore di\\x00cult path to pull o\\x00. That path requires a “strong peacemaker” who\\ngoes out of their way to bring the country together, including reaching out to\\nthe other side to involve them in the decision making and reshaping the order ina way that most people agree is fair and works well (i.e., is highly productive in a\\nway that bene\\x00ts most people). There are few such cases in history. We pray\\nfor them. The second type is a “strong \\x00ghter” who is capable of taking the\\ncountry through the hell of civil war/revolution.\\nStage 6: When Ther e Are Civil W ars\\nCivil wars  inevitably happen, so rather than assuming “it won’t happen here,” which most\\npeople in most countries assume after an extended period of not having them, it is better to\\nbe wary of them and look for the mark ers to indicate how close one is. While in the last\\nsection we looked at nonviolent revolutions that took place within the order, in\\nthis section we will be looking at the markers and the patterns of civil wars and\\nrevolutions that were almost always violent and toppled the old order and\\nreplaced it with a new one. Though there are innumerable examples that I\\ncould have examined to understand how they work, I chose what I\\nbelieve are the 29 most signi\\x00cant ones, which are shown in the\\nfollowing table. I categorized this group into those that produced big\\nchanges to the system/regime and those that did not. For example, the US\\nCivil War was a really bloody civil war that failed to overturn the system/order,\\nso it is in the second group at the bottom of the table, while those that toppled\\nthe system/order are at the top. These categories are of course imprecise, but\\nonce again we won’t let imprecision stand in the way of seeing what we couldn’t\\nsee if we insisted on being precise. Most of these con\\x00icts, though not all of\\nthem, transpired in the archetypical way described in this section.A classic example of a civil war breaking the system and having to build a new\\nsystem is the Russian Revolution/Civil War of 1917. This put into place the\\ncommunist internal order that eventually entered Stage 5 in the late 1980s,which led it to attempt to make revolutionary changes within the system—called\\nperestroika (i.e., restructuring)—which failed and were followed by the collapse\\nof the Soviet Union’s order in 1991. The communist domestic order lasted 74\\nyears (from 1917 until 1991). That order was replaced by the new system/order\\nthat is now governing Russia, which, after the collapse of the old order, was built\\nin the classic ways described earlier in this chapter in my explanations of Stages 1\\nand 2.\\nAnother is Japan’s Meiji Restoration, which came about as a result of a three-\\nyear revolution (1866–69) that happened because the Japanese were closed o\\x00 to\\nthe outside world and failed to advance. The Americans forced the Japanese to\\nopen, which prompted a revolutionary group to \\x00ght and defeat the rulers (led\\nby the military shogun) in battle, which led to overturning the internal order\\nthen run by the four classes—the military, farmers, artisans, and merchants—\\nthat had ruled Japan. This old Japanese order run by traditional people was\\nultra-conservative (e.g., social mobility was outlawed) and was replaced by\\nrevolutionaries who were relatively progressive and changed everything by\\nreinstating the powers of a modernizing emperor. Early in this period there were\\nlots of labor disputes, strikes, and riots that resulted from the classic triggers of\\nwealth gaps and bad economic conditions. In the reform process the leadership\\nprovided universal elementary education for both boys and girls, adopted\\ncapitalism, and opened the country up to the outside world. They did this with\\nnew technologies, which led them to become very competitive and gain wealth.\\nThere are many such cases of countries that did the right things to produce\\nrevolutionarily bene\\x00cial improvements, just as there are many cases of\\nrevolutionaries doing the wrong things that in\\x00icted terrible pain on their\\npeople for decades. By the way, as a result of its reformations Japan went on to\\nmove through the classic stages of the Big Cycle. It became extremely successful\\nand rich. But over time it became decadent, overextended, and fragmented, had\\nan economic depression, and fought expensive wars, all of which led to a classic\\ndemise. Its Meiji order and its classic Big Cycle lasted for 76 years from 1869 to\\n1945.\\n Civil wars and revolutions inevitably take place to radically change the internal order.\\nThey include total restructurings of wealth and political power that include completerestructurings of debt and ﬁnancial ownership and political decision making.  These\\nchanges are the natural consequence of needing to make big changes that can’t\\nbe made within the existing system. Almost all systems encounter them. That is\\nbecause almost all systems bene\\x00t some classes of people at the expense of other\\nclasses, which eventually becomes intolerable to the point that there is a \\x00ght to\\ndetermine the path forward. When the gaps in wealth and values become very\\nwide and bad economic conditions ensue so that the system is not working for a\\nlarge percentage of the people, the people will \\x00ght to change the system. Those\\nwho are su\\x00ering the most economically will \\x00ght to get more wealth and power\\nfrom those who have wealth and power and who bene\\x00t from the existing\\nsystem. Naturally the revolutionaries want to radically change the system, so\\nnaturally they are willing to break the laws that those in power demand they\\nadhere to. These revolutionary changes typically happen violently through civil\\nwars, though as previously described, they can come about peacefully without\\ntoppling the system.\\nThe periods of civil war are typically very brutal. Typically, early on\\nthese wars are forceful and orderly struggles for power, and as the \\x00ghting and\\nemotions intensify and the sides do anything to win, the levels of brutality\\naccelerate unexpectedly such that the actual levels of brutality that occur in the\\nStage 6 civil wars and revolutions would have been considered implausible in\\nStage 5. The elites and moderates generally \\x00ee, are imprisoned, or are killed.\\nReading the stories of civil wars and revolutions, such as the Spanish Civil War,\\nthe Chinese Civil War, the Russian Revolution, and the French Revolution,\\nmade my hair curl.\\nHow do they transpire? Earlier I described the dynamics of Stage 5 that led to\\ncrossing the line into Stage 6. During this stage all of those intensify greatly. I\\nwill explain.\\nHow Civil W ars and Re volutions T ranspir e\\nAs previously described, the cycle of building wealth and wealth gaps that leads\\nto a very small percentage of the population controlling an exceptionally large\\npercentage of the wealth eventually results in the poor majority overthrowingthe rich minority via civil wars and revolutions. This has happened more times\\nthan one can imagine.\\nWhile most of the archetypical civil wars and revolutions shifted\\npower from the right to the left, many shifted wealth and power to the\\nright and away from those on the left. However, there were fewer of them\\nand they were di\\x00erent. They typically happened when the existing orders\\nslipped into dysfunctional anarchies and a large percentage of the population\\nyearned for strong leadership, discipline, and productivity. Examples of\\nrevolutions from the left to the right include Germany, Spain, Japan, and Italy in\\nthe 1930s; the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1980s to the early 1990s; the 1976\\ncoup in Argentina replacing Isabel Perón with a military junta; and the coup\\nleading to the Second French Empire in 1851. All those that I examined worked\\nor didn’t work for the same reason. Like those of the left, these new internal\\norders succeeded when they produced broad-based economic successes and\\nfailed when they did not. Because broad economic prosperity is the biggest\\nreason a new regime succeeds or fails, the long-term trends have been to both\\ngreater total wealth and broader distribution of the wealth (i.e., better economic\\nand health outcomes for the average person). That big picture can be easily lost\\nwhen one is in and experiencing one part of the Big Cycle.\\nTypically the people who led the civil war/revolution were (and still\\nare) well-educated people from middle-class backgrounds. For example,\\nthree of the key revolutionary leaders of the French Revolution were Georges-\\nJacques Danton, a lawyer raised in a bourgeois family; Jean-Paul Marat, a\\nphysician, scientist, and journalist raised in a bourgeois family; and Maximilian\\nRobespierre, a lawyer and statesman also from a bourgeois family. This\\nrevolution was initially supported by many liberal aristocrats, like the Marquis\\nde Lafayette, who were raised in moderately well-o\\x00 families. Similarly, the\\nleaders of the Russian Revolution were Vladimir Lenin, who studied law, and\\nLeon Trotsky, who was raised in a bourgeois family of intellectuals. The Chinese\\nCivil War was led by Mao, who was from a moderately well-o\\x00 family and\\nstudied a variety of subjects such as law, economics, and political theory, and\\nZhou Enlai, who was from a scholarly middle-class family of civil servants.\\nThese leaders also typically were (and still are) charismatic and able tolead and work well with others to build big, well-run organizations that\\nhave the power to bring about the revolutions. If you want to look for\\nthe revolutionaries of the future, you might keep an eye on those who\\nhave these qualities. Over time they typically evolve from being idealistic\\nintellectuals wanting to change the system to be fairer to brutal\\nrevolutionaries bent on winning at all costs.\\nWhile having large wealth gaps during economically di\\x00cult times\\nwas typically the biggest source of con\\x00ict, there were always other\\nreasons for con\\x00ict that added up to a lot of opposition to the leadership\\nand the system. Typically in revolutions the revolutionaries with these di\\x00erent\\ngrievances joined together to make revolutionary changes; while they looked\\nunited during the revolution, after winning the revolution, they typically fought\\nwith each other over issues and for power.\\nAs previously mentioned, during the civil war/revolution stage of the\\ncycle the governments in power almost always had an acute shortage of\\nmoney, credit, and buying power. That shortage created the desire to\\ngrab money from those who had it, which led those who had wealth to\\nmove it into places and assets that were safe, which led the governments\\nto stop these movements by imposing capital controls—i.e., controls on\\nmovements to other jurisdictions (e.g., other countries), to other\\ncurrencies, or to assets that are more di\\x00cult to tax and/or are less\\nproductive (e.g., gold).\\nTo make matters even worse, when there was internal disorder,\\nforeign enemies were more likely to challenge the country. This happens\\nbecause domestic con\\x00ict causes vulnerabilities that make external wars more\\nlikely. Internal con\\x00ict splits the people within a country, is \\x00nancially taxing on\\nthem, and demands attention that leaves less time for the leaders to tend to other\\nissues—all things that create vulnerabilities for foreign powers to take advantage\\nof. That is the main reason why internal wars and external wars tend to come\\nclose together. Other reasons include: emotions and tempers are heightened;\\nstrong populist leaders who tend to come to power at such times are \\x00ghters by\\nnature; when there are internal con\\x00icts leaders \\x00nd that a perceived threat from\\nan external enemy can bring the country together in support of the leader sothey tend to encourage the con\\x00ict; and being deprived leads people/countries to\\nbe more willing to \\x00ght for what they need, including resources that other\\ncountries have.\\n Almost all civil wars have had some  foreign powers participating in attempt to\\ninﬂuence the outcome t o their beneﬁt.\\n The begin nings of civil wars and revolutions aren’t clear when they are happening,\\nthough they are obvious when one is deeply in the middle of them.  While historians\\nassign dates to the beginnings and ends of civil wars, they are arbitrary. The\\ntruth is that almost no one at the time knows that a civil war has begun or that it\\nhas ended, but they know when they are in them. For example, many historians\\nhave designated July 14, 1789, as the day the French Revolution began because a\\nmob stormed an armory and prison called the Bastille. But nobody at the time\\nthought it was the beginning of the French Revolution or had any idea how\\nterribly brutal that civil war and revolution would become. While one might not\\nknow what’s to come, one can have imprecise markers that help one place where\\none is, to see the direction that one is moving in, and to know something about\\nwhat the next stage will be like.\\nCivil wars are incredibly brutal because they are \\x00ghts to the death. Everyone\\nis an extremist because everyone is forced to pick a side and \\x00ght—also\\nmoderates lose out in knife \\x00ghts.\\nAs for what types of leaders are best for civil wars and revolutions,\\nthey are the “inspirational generals”—people who are strong enough to\\nmarshal support and win the various types of battles they have to win.\\nBecause the \\x00ght is brutal they have to be brutal enough to do whatever\\nis necessary to win.\\nThe time that historians stamp as the civil war period typically lasts a few\\nyears and determines the o\\x00cial winners and losers, which is conveyed by who\\ngets to occupy the government buildings in the capital. But like the beginnings,\\nthe ends of civil wars/revolutions are not as clearly de\\x00ned as historians convey.\\nThe \\x00ghting to consolidate power can go on for a long time after the o\\x00cial civil\\nwar has ended.\\nWhile civil wars and revolutions are typically extremely painful, they\\noften lead to restructurings that, if done well, can establish thefoundation for improved future results. What the future after the civil\\nwar/revolution looks like depends on how the next steps are handled.\\nCONCLUSION\\nMy study of history has taught me that nothing is forever other than evolution,\\nand within evolution there are cycles that are like tides that come in and go out\\nand that are hard to change or \\x00ght against. To handle these changes well it is\\nessential to know which stage of the cycle one is in and to know timeless and\\nuniversal principles for dealing with it. As conditions change the best\\napproaches change—i.e., what is best depends on the circumstances and the\\ncircumstances are always changing in the ways we just looked at. For that reason\\nit is a mistake to rigidly believe that any economic or political system is always\\nbest because there will certainly be times when that system is not best for the\\ncircumstances at hand, and if a society doesn’t adapt it will die. That is why\\nconstantly reforming systems to adapt well is best. The test of any system is\\nsimply how well it works in delivering what most of the people want, and this\\ncan be objectively measured, which we can do and will continue to do. Having\\nsaid that, the lesson from history that comes through most loudly and most\\nclearly is that skilled collaborations to produce productive win-win relationships\\nto both grow and divide the pie well, so that most people are happy, are much\\nmore rewarding and much less painful than \\x00ghting civil wars over wealth and\\npower that lead to one side subjugating the other side.\\n1 To get a rich picture of what makes great leaders great in di\\x00erent types of circumstances, I recommend\\nHenry Kissinger’s forthcoming book on leadership.\\n2 This chart is based on historical analysis of nine great powers (covering about 2,200 years of history in\\ntotal). The likelihood of con\\x00ict is based on major cases of civil war, rebellion, and revolution but excludes\\npeaceful revolutions that did not change the existing system. The analysis does not count the probability of\\ncon\\x00ict arising in a period when a country is already in the midst of internal con\\x00ict (and the \\x00ve years\\nfollowing) to avoid counting periods in which economic conditions were bad because of the con\\x00ict itself.3 To be clear, when a government’s \\x00nances are in bad shape that does not necessarily mean it will run out\\nof buying power. But it does mean that there is a much higher risk of that happening than if the\\ngovernment were in a \\x00nancially strong position.\\n4 Of course, these two kinds of struggles aren’t equivalent. Still, in both cases, I have found that people are\\nfocused on their own issues and communities and don’t understand the circumstances of those they don’t\\nhave direct contact with. In many communities, people—and most heartbreakingly the children—are\\ndesperately poor and neglected. There is an acute shortage of money for basics, such as adequate school\\nsupplies, nutrition, and healthcare, and an environment of violence and trauma that perpetuates a cycle in\\nwhich children are brought up intellectually and physically malnourished and traumatized; this leaves them\\ndisadvantaged as they grow into adulthood, which makes it hard for them to earn a living, which\\nperpetuates the cycle. Consider this fact: a recent study that our foundation funded showed that 22 percent\\nof the high school students in Connecticut—the richest state in the country by income per capita—are\\neither “disengaged” or “disconnected.” A disengaged student is one who has an absentee rate of greater than\\n25 percent and is failing classes. A disconnected student is one who the system can’t track because they\\ndropped out. Imagine the consequences in 10 years and the human and social costs of this cycle. Our\\nsociety has not established limits to how terrible it will allow conditions to get.\\n5 Viscount Northcli\\x00e, who controlled just under half of daily newspaper circulation in the UK around\\nWorld War I, was known for anti-German coverage and was made “Director of Propaganda in Enemy\\nCountries” by the government in 1918.\\n6 What can be done? The news media is unique in being the only industry that operates without quality\\ncontrols or checks on its power. I and most others believe that it would be terrible for our government to\\nregulate it and, at the same time, believe that something has to be done to \\x00x the problem. Perhaps if people\\nprotest enough the media could be motivated to create a self-regulatory organization to create and regulate\\nratings the way the Motion Picture Association did. I don’t have a clue about what should be done because\\nthis problem isn’t in my areas of expertise, and it’s not my place to o\\x00er suggestions to try to \\x00x the\\nproblem; however, it is my responsibility to point out that we are in an era in which sensationalism,\\ncommercialism, and political desires to manipulate people’s views have superseded accuracy and journalistic\\nintegrity as the primary objectives of most of those in the media and that this is like a cancer that threatens\\nour well-being. If you believe that fake and distorted media is a problem and you are interested in watching\\nthe media/propaganda for clues about whether and how this is transpiring, here are a few commonly\\nrecommended things to look out for. Ask yourself:\\n1) Does the story consist of emotionally triggering, unsubstantiated accusations, or are the facts\\nsubstantiated and the sources provided? When the facts are put aside to create an exciting story and\\nthe sources are undisclosed, don’t believe the story.\\n2) Does the writer welcome or not welcome replies or arguments that refute what they are asserting,\\nand are they willing or not willing to publish them along with what they published?\\n3) Are the accusations in the story consistent with what has been identi\\x00ed and proven in the legal\\nsystem? If people or groups are accused in the media of doing bad things but they haven’t been\\naccused and judged to have done bad things in the legal system (which follows a process that tries to\\nweigh the evidence to get at what is true), at least ask yourself why that is and probably don’t believe\\nthe story.\\n4) If the writer or outlet has previously shown themselves to be biased, assume that they and their\\nstories are biased.7 The Roman Republic and Athens both had democratic elements, but not everyone was able to\\nparticipate or vote equally. Although democracies have existed for thousands of years, it is only recently that\\nmost people were allowed to vote. For example, in the US, African-American men were not universally\\nallowed to vote until 1870, and women of all races until 1920.CHAPTER 6\\nTHE BIG CYCLE OF EXTERNAL ORDER\\nAND DISORDER\\nRelationships between people and the orders that govern them work in basically\\nthe same ways, whether they are internal or external, and they blend together. In\\nfact, it wasn’t long ago that there were no distinctions between internal and\\nexternal orders because there were no clearly de\\x00ned and mutually recognized\\nboundaries between countries. For that reason, the six-stage cycle of going\\nbetween order and disorder that I described in the last chapter about\\nwhat happens within countries works the same way between countries,\\nwith one big exception: \\n international relations are driven much more by raw power\\ndynamics.  That is because all governance systems require e\\x00ective and\\nagreed-upon 1) laws and law-making abilities, 2) law enforcement\\ncapabilities (e.g., police), 3) ways of adjudicating (e.g., judges), and 4)\\nclear and speci\\x00ed consequences that both suit crimes and are enforced\\n(e.g., \\x00nes and incarcerations), and those things either don’t exist or are\\nnot as e\\x00ective in guiding relations between countries as they are in\\nguiding relations within them.\\nWhile attempts have been made to make the external order more rule-abiding\\n(e.g., via the League of Nations and the United Nations), by and large they have\\nfailed because these organizations have not had more wealth and power than the\\nmost powerful countries. When individual countries have more power than\\nthe collectives of countries, the more powerful individual countries rule.\\nFor example, if the US, China, or other countries have more power than\\nthe United Nations, then the US, China, or other countries willdetermine how things go rather than the United Nations. That is\\nbecause power prevails, and wealth and power among equals is rarely\\ngiven up without a \\x00ght.\\nWhen powerful countries have disputes, they don’t get their lawyers to plead\\ntheir cases to judges. Instead, they threaten each other and either reach\\nagreements or \\x00ght. The international order follows the law of the jungle\\nmuch more than it follows international law.\\nThere are \\x00ve major kinds of \\x00ghts between countries:\\ntrade/economic wars, technology wars, capital wars, geopolitical wars,\\nand military wars. Let’s begin by brie\\x00y de\\x00ning them.\\n1. Trade/economic wars: Con\\x00icts over tari\\x00s, import/export restrictions,\\nand other ways of damaging a rival economically\\n2. Technology wars: Con\\x00icts over which technologies are shared and which\\nare held as protected aspects of national security\\n3. Geopolitical wars: Con\\x00icts over territory and alliances that are resolved\\nthrough negotiations and explicit or implicit commitments, not \\x00ghting\\n4. Capital wars: Con\\x00icts imposed through \\x00nancial tools such as sanctions\\n(e.g., cutting o\\x00 money and credit by punishing institutions and\\ngovernments that o\\x00er it) and limiting foreign access to capital markets\\n5. Military wars: Con\\x00icts that involve actual shooting and the deployment\\nof military forces\\nMost \\x00ghts between nations fall under one or more of those categories (cyber\\nwarfare, for example, has a role in all of them). They are over wealth and power\\nand the ideologies pertaining to them. While most of these types of wars\\ndon’t involve shooting and killing, they all are power struggles. In most\\ncases, the \\x00rst four kinds of war will evolve over time as intense competitions\\nbetween rival nations until a military war begins. These struggles and wars,\\nwhether or not they involve shooting and killing, are exertions of power\\nof one side over the other. They can be all-out or contained, depending\\non how important the issue is and what the relative powers of theopponents are. But once a military war begins, all four of the other\\ndimensions will be weaponized to the greatest extent possible.\\nAs discussed in the last several chapters, all of the factors that drive\\ninternal and external cycles tend to improve and worsen together. When\\nthings get bad, there are more things to argue over, which leads to\\ngreater inclinations to \\x00ght. That’s human nature, and it is why we have\\nthe Big Cycle, which oscillates between good times and bad ones.\\n All-out wars typically occur when exist ential issues (ones that are so essential to the\\ncountr y’s existence that people are willing to ﬁght and die for them) are at stak e and they\\ncannot be resolv ed by peaceful means. The wars that result from them mak e it clear which\\nside gets its way and has supr emacy in subsequent matters.  That clarity over who sets\\nthe rules then becomes the basis of a new international order.\\nThe following chart shows the cycles of internal and external peace and\\ncon\\x00ict in Europe going back to 1500 as re\\x00ected in the deaths they caused. As\\nyou can see, there were three big cycles of rising and declining con\\x00ict,\\naveraging about 150 years each. Though big civil and external wars last\\nonly a short time, they are typically the culmination of the longstanding\\ncon\\x00icts that led up to them. While World Wars I and II were separately\\ndriven by the classic cycle, they were also interrelated.\\nAs you can see, each cycle consisted of a relatively long period of peace\\nand prosperity (e.g., the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the\\nIndustrial Revolution) that sowed the seeds for terrible and violent\\nexternal wars (e.g., the Thirty Years’ War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the\\ntwo World Wars). Both the upswings (the periods of peace and prosperity) and\\nthe downswings (the periods of depression and war) a\\x00ected the whole world.\\nNot all countries prosper when the leading powers do because countries gain at\\nthe expense of others. For example, the decline of China from around 1840 to\\n1949, known as the “Century of Humiliation,” came about because the Western\\npowers and Japan exploited China.\\nAs you read on, keep in mind that \\n the two things about war that one can be most\\nconﬁdent in are 1) that it won’t go as planned and 2) that it will be far worse than imagined .\\nIt is for those reasons that so many of the principles that follow are about ways\\nto avoid shooting wars. Still, whether they are fought for good reasons or bad,\\nshooting wars happen. To be clear, while I believe most are tragic and fought for\\nnonsensical reasons, some are worth \\x00ghting because the consequences of not\\n\\x00ghting them (e.g., the loss of freedom) would be intolerable.\\nTHE TIMELESS AND UNIVERSAL FORCES THAT\\nPRODUCE CHANGES TO THE EXTERNAL\\nORDER\\nAs I explained in Chapter 2, after self-interest and self-survival, the quest for\\nwealth and power is what most motivates individuals, families, companies,\\nstates, and countries. Because wealth equals power in terms of the ability to\\nbuild military strength, control trade, and in\\x00uence other nations, \\n domestic and\\nmilitar y str ength go hand in hand . It takes money to buy guns (military power) and it\\ntakes money to buy butter (domestic social spending needs). When a country\\nfails to provide adequate amounts of either, it becomes vulnerable to domestic\\nand foreign opposition. From my study of Chinese dynasties and European\\nempires, I’ve learned that \\n the ﬁnanc ial strength to outspend one’s rivals is one of themost impor tant strengths a countr y can have. That is how the United States beat the\\nSoviet Union in the Cold War. Spend enough money in the right ways, and you\\ndon’t have to have a shooting war. Long-term success depends on sustaining\\nboth the “guns” and the “butter” without producing the excesses that lead to\\ntheir declines. In other words, a country must be strong enough \\x00nancially to\\ngive its people both a good living standard and protection from outside enemies.\\nThe really successful countries have been able to do that for 200 to 300 years.\\nNone has been able to do it forever.\\nCon\\x00ict arises when the dominant power begins to weaken or an emerging\\npower begins to approach it in strength—or both. \\n The greatest risk of militar y war\\nis when both parties have 1) milit ary powers that are roughly compar able and 2)\\nirreconcilable and existential differences.  As of this writing, the most potentially\\nexplosive con\\x00ict is that between the United States and China over Taiwan.\\nThe choice that opposing countries face—either \\x00ghting or backing\\ndown—is very hard to make. Both are costly—\\x00ghting in terms of lives\\nand money, and backing down in terms of the loss of status, since it\\nshows weakness, which leads to reduced support. When two competing\\nentities each have the power to destroy the other, both must have extremely high\\ntrust that they won’t be unacceptably harmed or killed by the other. Managing\\nthe prisoner’s dilemma well, however, is extremely rare (see the addendum to\\nChapter 2 for a full explanation).\\nWhile there are no rules in international relations other than those the most\\npowerful impose on themselves, some approaches produce better outcomes than\\nothers. Speci\\x00cally, those that are more likely to lead to win-win outcomes are\\nbetter than those that lead to lose-lose outcomes. Hence this all-important\\nprinciple: \\n to get more win-win  outcomes one needs to negotiate with consider ation given\\nto what is most impor tant t o the other par ty and t o oneself, and know how t o trade them.1,2\\nSkilled collaborations to produce win-win relationships that both increase\\nand divide up wealth and power well are much more rewarding and much less\\npainful than wars that lead to one side subjugating the other. Seeing things\\nthrough your adversary’s eyes and clearly identifying and communicating your\\nred lines to them (i.e., what cannot be compromised) are the keys to doing this\\nwell. \\n Winning means getting the things that are most impor tant without losing the thingsthat are most impor tant, so wars that cost much more in lives and mone y than they provide\\nin beneﬁts are stup id. But “stupid” wars still happen all the time for reasons that I\\nwill explain.\\nIt is far too easy to slip into stupid wars because of a) the prisoner’s dilemma,\\nb) a tit-for-tat escalation process, c) the perceived costs of backing down for the\\ndeclining power, and d) misunderstandings existing when decision making has\\nto be fast. Rival great powers typically \\x00nd themselves in the prisoner’s dilemma;\\nthey need to have ways of assuring the other that they won’t try to kill them lest\\nthe other tries to kill them \\x00rst. Tit-for-tat escalations are dangerous in that they\\nrequire each side to escalate or lose what the enemy captured in the last move; it\\nis like a game of chicken—push it too far and there is a head-on crash.\\nUntruthful and emotional appeals that rile people up increase the dangers of\\nstupid wars, so it is better for leaders to be truthful and thoughtful in explaining\\nthe situation and how they are dealing with it (this is especially essential in a\\ndemocracy, in which the opinions of the population matter). The worst thing is\\nwhen leaders are untruthful and emotional in dealing with their populations,\\nand it is worse still when they take over the media.\\nBy and large, the tendency to move between win-win relationships\\nand lose-lose relationships happens in a cyclical way. People and empires\\nare more likely to have cooperative relationships during good times and\\nto \\x00ght during bad times. When the existing great power is declining in\\nrelation to a rising power, it has a natural tendency to want to maintain the\\nstatus quo or the existing rules, while the rising power wants to change them to\\nbe in line with the changing facts on the ground.\\nWhile I don’t know about the love part of the saying “all is fair in love\\nand war,” I know the war part is right. As an example, in the American\\nRevolutionary War, when the British lined up in rows for the \\x00ght and\\nthe American revolutionaries shot at them from behind trees, the British\\nthought that was unfair and complained. The revolutionaries won\\nbelieving the British were foolish and that the cause of independence and\\nfreedom justi\\x00ed changing the rules of war. That’s just how it is.\\nThis leads me to one \\x00nal principle: \\n have powe r, respec t power , and use power\\nwisely . Having power is good because power will win out over agreements, rules,and laws all the time. When push comes to shove, those who have the power to\\neither enforce their interpretation of the rules and laws or to overturn them will\\nget what they want. It is important to respect power because it’s not smart to\\n\\x00ght a war that one is going to lose; it is preferable to negotiate the best\\nsettlement possible (that is unless one wants to be a martyr, which is usually for\\nstupid ego reasons rather than for sensible strategic reasons). It is also important\\nto use power wisely. Using power wisely doesn’t necessarily mean forcing others\\nto give you what you want—i.e., bullying them. It includes the recognition that\\ngenerosity and trust are powerful forces for producing win-win relationships,\\nwhich are fabulously more rewarding than lose-lose relationships. In other\\nwords, it is often the case that using one’s “hard powers” is not the best path and\\nthat using one’s “soft powers” is preferable.3\\nWhen thinking about how to use power wisely, it’s also important to decide\\nwhen to reach an agreement and when to \\x00ght. To do that, a party must imagine\\nhow its power will change over time. It is desirable to use one’s power to\\nnegotiate an agreement, enforce an agreement, or \\x00ght a war when one’s power\\nis greatest. That means that it pays to \\x00ght early if one’s relative power is\\ndeclining and \\x00ght later if it’s rising.\\nIf one is in a lose-lose relationship, one has to get out of it one way or\\nanother, preferably through separation, though possibly through war. To handle\\none’s power wisely, it’s usually best not to show it because it will usually lead\\nothers to feel threatened and build their own threatening powers, which will\\nlead to a mutual escalation that threatens both. Power is usually best handled\\nlike a hidden knife that can be brought out in the event of a \\x00ght. But there are\\ntimes when showing one’s power and threatening to use it are most e\\x00ective for\\nimproving one’s negotiating position and preventing a \\x00ght. Knowing what\\nmatters most and least to the other party, especially what they will and won’t\\n\\x00ght for, allows you to work your way toward an equilibrium that both parties\\nconsider a fair resolution of a dispute.\\nThough it is generally desirable to have power, it is also desirable to not have\\npower that one doesn’t need. That is because maintaining power consumes\\nresources, most importantly your time and your money. Also, with power comesthe burden of responsibilities. I have often been struck by how much happier\\nless powerful people can be relative to more powerful people.\\nCASE STUDY: WORLD WAR II\\nNow that we have covered the dynamics and principles that drive the external\\norder and disorder cycle, which were derived by looking at many cases, I’d like to\\nbrie\\x00y look at the World War II case because it provides the most recent example\\nof the iconic dynamic of going from peace to war. Though it is only one case, it\\nclearly shows how the con\\x00uence of the three big cycles—i.e., the overlapping\\nand interrelated forces of the money and credit cycle, the internal order/disorder\\ncycle, and the external order/disorder cycle—created the conditions for a\\ncatastrophic war and laid the groundwork for a new world order. While the\\nstories from this period are very interesting in and of themselves, they are\\nespecially important because they provide lessons that help us think about what\\nis happening now and what might be ahead. Most importantly, the United\\nStates and China are in an economic war that could conceivably evolve into a\\nmilitary war and comparisons between the 1930s and today provide valuable\\ninsights into what might happen and how to avoid a terrible war.\\nTHE PATH TO WAR\\nTo help convey the picture of the 1930s, I will run through the geopolitical\\nhighlights leading up to the o\\x00cial start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the\\nbombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Then I will quickly move through the war\\nand the start of the new world order in 1945, with the US at the peak of its\\npower.\\nThe global depression that followed the Great Crash of 1929 led to almost all\\ncountries having big internal con\\x00icts over wealth. This caused them to turn to\\nmore populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders and policies.These moves were either to the right or to the left and occurred in varying\\ndegrees, according to the countries’ circumstances and the strengths of their\\ndemocratic or autocratic traditions. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain,\\nextremely bad economic circumstances and less well-established democratic\\ntraditions led to extreme internal con\\x00icts and a turn to populist/autocratic\\nleaders of the right (i.e., fascists), just as at di\\x00erent points in time the Soviet\\nUnion and China, which also endured extreme circumstances and had no\\nexperience with democracy, turned to populist/autocratic leaders of the left (i.e.,\\ncommunists). The US and the UK had much stronger democratic traditions and\\nless severe economic conditions, so they became more populist and autocratic\\nthan they had been, but not nearly as much as other nations.\\nGermany and Japan\\nWhile Germany had previously been saddled with tremendous reparation debts\\nfollowing World War I, by 1929 it was beginning to emerge from under their\\nyoke via the Young Plan, which provided for considerable debt relief and the\\ndeparture of foreign troops from Germany by 1930.4 But the global depression\\nhit Germany hard, leading to nearly 25 percent unemployment, massive\\nbankruptcies, and extensive poverty. As is typical, there was a struggle between\\npopulists of the left (communists) and populists of the right (fascists). Adolf\\nHitler, the leading populist/fascist, tapped into the mood of national\\nhumiliation to build a nationalistic furor, casting the Treaty of Versailles and the\\ncountries that imposed it as the enemy. He created a 25-point nationalistic\\nprogram and rallied support around it. In response to internal \\x00ghting and the\\ndesire to restore order, Hitler was appointed chancellor in January 1933,\\ndrawing large support for his Nazi Party from industrialists who feared the\\ncommunists. Two months later, the Nazi Party won the most support and the\\nmost seats in the German Parliament (the Reichstag).\\nHitler refused to pay any further reparation debts, left the League of Nations,\\nand took autocratic control of Germany in 1934. Holding the dual roles of\\nchancellor and president, he became the country’s supreme leader. In\\ndemocracies there are always some laws that allow leaders to grab special powers;Hitler seized them all. He invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to put\\nan end to many civil rights and suppress political opposition from the\\ncommunists, and forced the passage of the Enabling Act, which allowed him to\\npass laws without the approval of the Reichstag and the president. He was\\nruthless against any opposition—he censored or took control of newspapers and\\nbroadcasting companies, created a secret police force (the Gestapo) to root out\\nand crush opposition, deprived Jews of their rights of citizenship, seized the\\nProtestant Church’s \\x00nances, and arrested church o\\x00cials who opposed him.\\nDeclaring the Aryan race superior, he prohibited non-Aryans from serving in\\ngovernment.\\nHitler took that same autocratic/fascist approach to rebuilding Germany’s\\neconomy, coupled with big \\x00scal and monetary stimulation programs. He\\nprivatized state-owned businesses and encouraged corporate investment, acting\\naggressively to raise Aryan Germans’ living standards. For example, he set up\\nVolkswagen to make cars a\\x00ordable and accessible, and he directed the building\\nof the Autobahn. He \\x00nanced this substantially increased government spending\\nby forcing banks to buy government bonds. The debts that were produced were\\npaid back by the earnings of companies and the central bank (the Reichsbank)\\nmonetizing debt. These \\x00scal policies by and large worked well in achieving\\nHitler’s goals. This is another example of how borrowing in one’s own currency\\nand increasing one’s own debt and de\\x00cits can be highly productive if the\\nmoney borrowed is put into investments that raise productivity and produce\\nmore than enough cash \\x00ow to service the debt. Even if it doesn’t cover 100\\npercent of the debt service, it can be very cost-e\\x00ective in achieving the economic\\ngoals of the country.\\nAs for the economic e\\x00ects of these policies, when Hitler came to power in\\n1933 the unemployment rate was 25 percent. By 1938 it was nil. Per capita\\nincome increased by 22 percent in the \\x00ve years after Hitler took power, and real\\ngrowth averaged over 8 percent per year between 1934 and 1938. As shown in\\nthe following charts, German equities rallied nearly 70 percent in a steady trend\\nbetween 1933 and 1938, until the onset of the hot war.In 1935, Hitler began to build the military, making military service\\ncompulsory for Aryans. Germany’s military spending increased much faster than\\nany other country because the German economy needed more resources to\\nfuel itself and it intended to use its military power to seize them.\\nLike Germany, Japan was also hit exceptionally hard by the depression\\nand became more autocratic in response. Japan was especially vulnerable to\\nthe depression because, as an island nation without adequate natural resources,\\nit relied on exports for income to import necessities. When its exports fell by\\naround 50 percent between 1929 and 1931, Japan was economically devastated.\\nIn 1931, Japan went broke—i.e., it was forced to draw down its gold reserves,\\nabandon the gold standard, and \\x00oat its currency, which depreciated it so greatly\\nthat Japan ran out of buying power. These terrible conditions and large\\nwealth gaps led to \\x00ghting between the left and the right. By 1932, there\\nwas a massive upsurge in right-wing nationalism and militarism, in the\\nhope that order and economic stability could be forcibly restored. Japan\\nset out to get the natural resources (e.g., oil, iron, coal, and rubber) and\\nhuman resources (i.e., slave labor) it needed by seizing them from other\\ncountries, invading Manchuria in 1931 and spreading out through China\\nand Asia. As with Germany, it could be argued that Japan’s path of\\nmilitary aggression to get needed resources was more cost-e\\x00ective than\\nrelying on classic trading and economic practices. In 1934, there was severe\\nfamine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing\\nthe right-wing, militaristic, nationalistic, and expansionistic movement.\\nIn the years that followed, Japan’s top-down fascist command\\neconomy grew stronger, building a military-industrial complex to protectits existing bases in East Asia and northern China and support its\\nexcursions into other countries. As was also the case in Germany, while\\nmost Japanese companies remained privately held, their production was\\ncontrolled by the government.\\nWhat is fascism? Consider the following three big choices that a\\ncountry has to make when selecting its approach to governance: 1)\\nbottom-up (democratic) or top-down (autocratic) decision making, 2)\\ncapitalist or communist (with socialist in the middle) ownership of\\nproduction, and 3) individualistic (which treats the well-being of the\\nindividual with paramount importance) or collectivist (which treats the\\nwell-being of the whole with paramount importance). Pick the one from\\neach category that you believe is optimal for your nation’s values and ambitions\\nand you have your preferred approach. Fascism is autocratic, capitalist, and\\ncollectivist. Fascists believe that top-down autocratic leadership, in which the\\ngovernment directs the production of privately held companies such that\\nindividual grati\\x00cation is subordinated to national success, is the best way to\\nmake the country and its people wealthier and more powerful.\\nThe US and the Allies\\nIn the US, debt problems became ruinous for American banks after 1929,\\nwhich curtailed their lending around the world, hurting international\\nborrowers. At the same time, the depression created weak demand, which led\\nto a collapse of US imports and other countries’ sales to the US. As incomes\\nweakened, demand fell and more credit problems occurred in a self-reinforcing\\ndownward economic spiral. The US responded by turning protectionist to\\nsafeguard jobs, raising tari\\x00s via the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tari\\x00 Act in\\n1930, which further depressed economic conditions in other countries.\\n Raising tariffs to protect domestic businesses and jobs during bad economic times is\\ncommon, but it lead s to reduced eﬃcie ncy because production does not occur wher e it can\\nbe done most eﬃciently . Ultimately, tari\\x00s contribute to greater global\\neconomic weakness, as tari\\x00 wars cause the countries that impose them\\nto lose exports. Tari\\x00s do, however, bene\\x00t the entities that are protectedby them, and they can create political support for the leaders who impose\\nthem.\\nThe Soviet Union had yet to recover from its devastating 1917–22 revolution\\nand civil war, a lost war to Germany, a costly war with Poland, and a famine in\\n1921, and it was wracked by political purges and economic hardships\\nthroughout the 1930s. China also su\\x00ered from civil war, poverty, and a famine\\nin 1928–30. So, when things worsened in 1930 and tari\\x00s began, bad\\nconditions became desperate conditions in those countries.\\nTo make matters worse, there were droughts in the US and in the Soviet\\nUnion in the 1930s. \\n Harmful acts of natur e (e.g., droughts, ﬂoods, and plagues) often\\ncause periods of great economic hardship that when combined with other adverse\\nconditions lead to periods of great conﬂ ict. In combination with extreme government\\npolicies, millions died in the USSR. At the same time, internal political \\x00ghting\\nand fears of Nazi Germany led to purges of hundreds of thousands of people\\nwho were accused of spying and shot without trials.\\n Deﬂationar y depr essions are debt crises caused by there not being enough mone y in\\nthe hands  of debt ors to service their debts. They inevitably lead to the printing of mone y,\\ndebt restructurings, and government spending programs that increase the supply of, and\\nreduce the v alue of, mone y and cr edit. The only question is how long it tak es for go vernment\\noﬃcials t o mak e this mo ve.\\nIn the case of the US, it took three and a half years from the crash in\\nOctober 1929 until President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s March 1933\\nactions. In Roosevelt’s \\x00rst 100 days in o\\x00ce, he created several massive\\ngovernment spending programs that were paid for by big tax increases\\nand big budget de\\x00cits \\x00nanced by debt that the Federal Reserve\\nmonetized. He instituted jobs programs, unemployment insurance, Social\\nSecurity supports, and labor- and union-friendly programs. After his 1935 tax\\nbill, then popularly called the “Soak the Rich Tax,” the top marginal income tax\\nrate for individuals rose to 75 percent (versus as low as 25 percent in 1930). By\\n1941, the top personal tax rate was 81 percent, and the top corporate tax rate\\nwas 31 percent, having started at 12 percent in 1930. Roosevelt also imposed a\\nnumber of other taxes. Despite all of these taxes and the pickup in the economy\\nthat helped raise tax revenue, budget de\\x00cits increased from around 1 percent ofGDP to about 4 percent of GDP because the spending increases were so large.5\\nFrom 1933 until the end of 1936 the stock market returned over 200\\npercent, and the economy grew at a blistering average real rate of about 9\\npercent.\\nIn 1936, the Federal Reserve tightened money and credit to \\x00ght\\nin\\x00ation and slow an overheating economy, which caused the fragile US\\neconomy to fall back into recession and the other major economies to\\nweaken with it, further raising tensions within and between countries.\\nMeanwhile in Europe, the con\\x00ict in Spain between the populists of the left\\n(the communists) and the populists of the right (the fascists) \\x00ared into the\\nbrutal Spanish Civil War. Right-wing Franco, with the support of Hitler,\\nsucceeded in purging left-wing opposition in Spain.\\n During periods of severe economic distr ess and large wealth gaps, there are typically\\nrevolutionarily large redistributions of wealth.  When done peacefully these are\\nachieved through large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the\\nsupply of money that devalue debtors’ claims, and when done violently\\nthey are achieved by forced asset con\\x00scations. In the US and the UK, while\\nthere were redistributions of wealth and political power, capitalism and\\ndemocracy were maintained. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain they were not.\\n Befor e there is a shooting war there is usually an economic war. As is also typical,\\nbefore all-out wars are declared there is about a decade of economic,\\ntechnological, geopolitical, and capital wars, during which the con\\x00icting\\npowers intimidate each other, testing the limits of each other’s power. While\\n1939 and 1941 are known as the o\\x00cial starts of the wars in Europe and the\\nPaci\\x00c, the con\\x00icts really began about 10 years before that. In addition to the\\neconomically motivated con\\x00icts within countries and the political shifts\\nthat arose from them, all of these countries faced increased external\\neconomic con\\x00icts as they fought for greater shares of a shrinking\\neconomic pie. Because power, and not law, rules international relations,\\nGermany and Japan became more expansionist and increasingly began to test the\\nUK, the US, and France in the competition over resources and in\\x00uence over\\nterritories.Before going on to describe the hot war, I want to elaborate on the\\ncommon tactics used when economic and capital tools are weaponized.\\nThey have been and still are:\\n1. Asset freezes/seizures: Preventing an enemy/rival from using or selling\\nforeign assets they rely on. These measures can range from asset freezes for\\ntargeted groups in a country (e.g., the current US sanctions of the Iranian\\nRevolutionary Guard or the initial US asset freeze against Japan in World\\nWar II) to more severe measures like unilateral debt repudiation or outright\\nseizures of a country’s assets (e.g., some top US policy makers have been\\ntalking about not paying our debts to China).\\n2. Blocking capital markets access: Preventing a country from accessing\\ntheir own or another country’s capital markets (e.g., in 1887 Germany\\nbanned the purchase of Russian securities and debt to impede Russia’s\\nmilitary buildup; the US is now threatening to do this to China).\\n3. Embargoes/blockades: Blocking trade in goods and/or services in one’s\\nown country and in some cases with neutral third parties for the purpose of\\nweakening the targeted country or preventing it from getting essential\\nitems (e.g., the US’s oil embargo on Japan and cutting o\\x00 its ships’ access to\\nthe Panama Canal in World War II) or blocking exports from the targeted\\ncountry to other countries, thus cutting o\\x00 their income (e.g., France’s\\nblockade of the UK in the Napoleonic Wars).\\nIf you’re interested in seeing how these tactics have been applied from 1600\\nuntil now, they are available at economicprinciples.org.\\nTHE HOT WAR BEGINS\\nIn November 1937, Hitler secretly met with his top o\\x00cials to announce his\\nplans for German expansion to gain resources and bring together the Aryan race.\\nThen he put them into action, \\x00rst annexing Austria and then seizing a part of\\nwhat was then Czechoslovakia that contained oil resources. Europe and the USwatched warily, not wanting to get drawn into another war so soon after the\\ndevastation of World War I.\\nAs with all wars, the unknowns were far greater than the knowns because a)\\nrival powers go into wars only when their powers are roughly comparable\\n(otherwise it would be stupidly suicidal for the obviously weaker power) and b)\\nthere are way too many possible actions and reactions to anticipate. The only\\nthing that is known at the outset of a hot war is that it will probably be\\nextremely painful and possibly ruinous. As a result, smart leaders typically go\\ninto them only if the other side has pushed them into a position of either\\n\\x00ghting or losing by backing down. For the Allies, that moment came on\\nSeptember 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.\\nGermany looked unstoppable; in short order it captured Denmark, Norway,\\nthe Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, and strengthened its\\nalliances with Japan and Italy, which had common enemies and were\\nideologically aligned. By seizing territory rapidly (e.g., oil-rich Romania), Hitler’s\\narmy was able to conserve its existing oil resources and gain new ones quickly.\\nThe thirst for, and acquisition of, natural resources remained a major driver of\\nthe Nazi war machine as it pushed its campaigns into Russia and the Middle\\nEast. War with the Soviets was inevitable; the only question was when. Although\\nGermany and the USSR had signed a non-aggression pact, Germany invaded\\nRussia in June 1941, which put Germany in an extremely costly war on two\\nfronts.\\nIn the Paci\\x00c in 1937, Japan expanded its occupation of China, brutally\\ntaking control of Shanghai and Nanking, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese\\ncivilians and disarmed combatants in the capture of Nanking alone. While the\\nUS remained isolationist, it did provide Chiang Kai-shek’s government with\\n\\x00ghter planes and pilots to counter the Japanese, putting a toe in the war.\\nCon\\x00icts between the US and Japan began to \\x00are. A Japanese soldier struck the\\nUS consul, John Moore Allison, in the face in Nanking and Japanese \\x00ghter\\nplanes sank a US gunship.\\nIn November 1940, Roosevelt won re-election after campaigning on the\\npromise to keep the US out of the war, even though the US was already taking\\neconomic actions to protect its interests, especially in the Paci\\x00c, using economicsupports to help countries it sympathized with and economic sanctions against\\nthose it did not. Earlier in 1940, Secretary of War Henry Stimson had initiated\\naggressive economic sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control\\nAct of 1940. In mid-1940, the US moved the US Paci\\x00c Fleet to Hawaii. In\\nOctober, the US ramped up the embargo, restricting “all iron and steel to\\ndestinations other than Britain and nations of the Western Hemisphere.” The\\nplan was to cut Japan o\\x00 from resources in order to force them to retreat from\\nmost of the areas they had taken over.\\nIn March 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the US\\nto lend or lease war supplies to the nations it deemed to be acting in ways that\\nwere “vital to the defense of the United States,” which included Great Britain,\\nthe Soviet Union, and China. Helping the Allies was good for the US both\\ngeopolitically and economically because it made a lot of money selling weapons,\\nfood, and other items to these soon-to-be-allied countries who were struggling to\\nmaintain production while waging war. But its motivations weren’t entirely\\nmercenary. Great Britain was running out of money (i.e., gold), so the US\\nallowed them to postpone payment until after the war (in some cases waiving\\npayment entirely). Although not an outright declaration of war, Lend-Lease\\ne\\x00ectively ended the United States’ neutrality.\\n When countries are weak, opposing countries take advantage of their weaknesses to\\nobtain gains.  France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain all had colonies in Asia.\\nOverstretched by the \\x00ghting in Europe, they were unable to defend them\\nagainst the Japanese. Starting in September 1940, Japan invaded several colonies\\nin Southeast Asia, beginning with French Indochina, adding what it called the\\nSouthern Resource Zone to its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In 1941,\\nJapan seized oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies.\\nThis Japanese territorial expansion was a threat to the US’s own Paci\\x00c\\nambitions. In July and August 1941, Roosevelt responded by freezing all\\nJapanese assets in the United States, closing the Panama Canal to Japanese ships,\\nand embargoing oil and gas exports to Japan. This cut o\\x00 three-fourths of\\nJapan’s trade and 80 percent of its oil. Japan calculated that it would run out of\\noil in two years. This put Japan in the position of having to choose between\\nbacking down or attacking the US.On December 7 and 8, 1941, Japan launched coordinated attacks on US\\nmilitary forces at Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines. This marked the\\nbeginning of the declared war in the Paci\\x00c, which brought the US into the war\\nin Europe too. While Japan didn’t have a widely recognized plan to win the war,\\nthe most optimistic Japanese leaders believed that the US would lose because it\\nwas \\x00ghting a war on two fronts and because its individualistic/capitalist\\npolitical system was inferior to Japan’s and Germany’s authoritarian/fascist\\nsystems with their command military-industrial complexes. They also believed\\nthat they had the greater willingness to endure pain and die for their country,\\nwhich is a big driver of which side wins. \\n In war one’s ability to withstand pain is even\\nmore impor tant than one ’s ability t o inﬂict pain.\\nWARTIME ECONOMIC POLICIES\\nJust as it is worth noting what classic economic war tactics are, it is also worth\\nnoting what classic wartime economic policies are within countries. These\\ninclude government controls on just about everything as the country shifts its\\nresources from pro\\x00t making to war making—e.g., the government determines\\na) what items are allowed to be produced, b) what items can be bought and sold\\nin what amounts (rationing), c) what items can be imported and exported, d)\\nprices, wages, and pro\\x00ts, e) access to one’s own \\x00nancial assets, and f) the ability\\nto move one’s own money out of the country. Because wars are expensive,\\nclassically the government g) issues lots of debt that is monetized, h) relies on\\nnon-credit money such as gold for international transactions because its credit is\\nnot accepted, i) governs more autocratically, j) imposes various types of\\neconomic sanctions on enemies, including cutting o\\x00 their access to capital, and\\nk) experiences enemies imposing these sanctions on them.\\nWhen the US entered the European and Paci\\x00c wars after the attack on Pearl\\nHarbor, classic wartime economic policies were put in place in most countries\\nby leaders whose more autocratic approaches were broadly supported by theirpopulations. The following table shows those economic controls in each of the\\nmajor countries.\\nWARTIME ECONOMIC CON TROLS\\n\\xa0 Rationing Production\\nContr olsPrice/W age\\nContr olsImpor t or\\nExpor t\\nRestrictionsTakeover of\\nCentr al\\nBank\\nAllies \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nUnited States Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\\nUnited Kingdom Yes Yes Yes Yes Partial\\nAxis \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nGermany Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\\nJapan Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\\nThe market movements during the hot war years were heavily a\\x00ected by\\nboth government controls and how countries did in battles as the odds of\\nwinning and losing changed.

I should also note that\\nmoney and credit were not commonly accepted between non-allied countries\\nduring the war because of a justi\\x00able wariness about whether the currency\\nwould have any value. As noted earlier, gold—or, in some cases, silver or barter—\\nis the coin of the realm during wars. At such times, prices and capital \\x00ows are\\ntypically controlled, so it is di\\x00cult to say what the real prices of many things\\nare.\\nBecause losing wars typically leads to a total wipeout of wealth and power,\\nmovements of those stock markets that remained open in the war years were\\nlargely driven by how countries did in key battles as these results shifted the\\nprobability of victory or defeat for each side. For example, German equities\\noutperformed at the beginning of World War II as Germany captured territory\\nand established military dominance, while they underperformed after Allied\\npowers like the US and the UK turned the tide of the war. After the 1942 Battle\\nof Midway, Allied equities rallied almost continuously until the end of the war,\\nwhile Axis equities were \\x00at or down. As shown, both the German and Japanese\\nstock markets were closed at the end of the war, didn’t reopen for around \\x00ve\\nyears, and were virtually wiped out when they did, while US stocks were\\nextremely strong.\\nProtecting one’s wealth in times of war is di\\x00cult, as normal economic\\nactivities are curtailed, traditionally safe investments are not safe, capital mobility\\nis limited, and high taxes are imposed when people and countries are \\x00ghting for\\ntheir survival. Protecting the wealth of those who have it is not a priority relative\\nto the need to redistribute wealth to get it to where it is needed most. As for\\ninvesting, sell out of all debt and buy gold because wars are \\x00nanced by\\nborrowing and printing money, which devalues debt and money, and because\\nthere is a justi\\x00able reluctance to accept credit.\\nCONCLUSION\\nEvery world power has its time in the sun, thanks to the uniqueness of their\\ncircumstances and the nature of their character and culture (e.g., they have the\\nessential elements of a strong work ethic, smarts, discipline, education, etc.), but\\nthey all eventually decline. Some do so more gracefully than others, with less\\ntrauma, but they nevertheless decline. Traumatic declines can lead to some of\\nthe worst periods in history, when big \\x00ghts over wealth and power prove\\nextremely costly both economically and in human lives.\\nStill, the cycle needn’t transpire this way if countries in their rich and\\npowerful stages stay productive, earn more than they spend, make the\\nsystem work well for most of their populations, and \\x00gure out ways of\\ncreating and sustaining win-win relationships with their most\\nsigni\\x00cant rivals. A number of empires and dynasties have sustained\\nthemselves for hundreds of years, and the United States, at 245 years old, has\\nproven itself to be one of the longest-lasting.\\nIn Part II, I will turn to the US, the two reserve currency empires that\\npreceded it, and the one that may someday follow it. As we continue, I hope this\\nexplanation of the archetypical Big Cycle and the three cycles that make it up\\nwill help you see the patterns of history and what they portend. But before we\\ndelve more deeply into the history, I’d \\x00rst like to share how these big three cycles\\n\\x00gure into my approach as an investor.1 To give an oversimpli\\x00ed example of a win-win approach, if each country picks the top 10 things that they\\nwant to get or want to be protected against and allocates 100 points in total to these to express how much\\nthey want these things, they could determine what the best trades would be. For example, I expect that high\\non China’s list would be the reuni\\x00cation with Taiwan—so high in fact that they would go to war for it. I\\ncan’t imagine that preventing that from happening peacefully would be nearly as high on the US’s list,\\nwhereas something on the US’s list would be very high so that they should be willing to trade it to make\\nboth sides happy.\\n2 Though it might sound naïve, I wish the power of thoughtful disagreement could be tapped to deal with\\nthe US-China wars. For example, I visualize how wonderful it would be if leaders or representatives of each\\ncountry were to have a series of publicly aired thoughtful disagreements, like presidential debates, that the\\npopulations of both countries could listen to in order to gain both sides’ perspectives. I’m sure it would\\nmake us much more knowledgeable and empathetic, and improve the chances of peaceful resolutions.\\n3 For example, though I always had the ownership power to make decisions at Bridgewater autocratically, I\\nchose not to use that power. Instead, I created and operated an idea-meritocratic system (which I described\\nin Principles: Life and Work). I also chose to be far more generous with the people I worked with than I had\\nto be while maintaining extremely high standards because I knew that operating that way would produce\\nthe amazing relationships and outcomes that we experienced—far better than if I had used my “hard\\npowers” more forcefully. So, it’s important to remember that great relationships give one great powers and\\nthat they are wonderful rewards in and of themselves. There is nothing more powerful and rewarding for\\nthe individual and the collective than the cooperation of capable people who care for each other and who\\nwill give each other all they can.\\n4 Speci\\x00c developments and detail on this period are explained in my book Principles for Navigating Big\\nDebt Crises.\\n5 Speci\\x00c developments through the Great Depression are explained in great detail in my book Principles\\nfor Navigating Big Debt Crises.CHAPTER 7\\nINVESTING IN LIGHT OF THE BIG CYCLE\\nThe game I play for handling both my life and my career is to try to\\n\\x00gure out how the world works, develop principles for dealing with it\\nwell, and then place my bets. The research that I’m sharing with you in\\nthis book was done for that purpose. Naturally, when I look at all that\\nwe’ve covered up to this point, I think about how it applies to my\\ninvesting. For me to be comfortable that I am doing that well, I need to\\nknow how my approach would have worked through time. If I can’t\\ncon\\x00dently explain what happened in the past, or at least have a strategy\\nfor dealing with it in light of what I don’t know, I consider myself\\ndangerously negligent.\\nAs you saw from my study of the last 500 years up to now, there were\\nBig Cycles of great accumulations and great losses of wealth and power,\\nand of these, the greatest contributing factor was the debt and capital\\nmarkets cycle. From an investor’s perspective, this could be called the Big\\nInvesting Cycle. I felt that I needed to understand these cycles well\\nenough to tactically move or diversify my portfolio to be protected\\nagainst them and/or to pro\\x00t from them. By understanding them, and\\nideally realizing where countries are in their cycles, I can do that.\\nOver my roughly 50 years as a global macro investor, I discovered\\nmany timeless and universal truths that form my principles for investing.\\nWhile I won’t get deeply into all of them here, but will discuss most of\\nthem in my next book, Principles: Economics and Investing, I will convey\\none important principle. All mark ets are primarily driven by just four determinants: growth, inﬂation, risk\\npremiums, and discount r ates.\\nThat is because all investments are exchanges of lump-sum payments today\\nfor future payments. What these future cash payments will be is determined by\\ngrowth and in\\x00ation, what risk investors are willing to take in investing in them\\nas compared to having cash in hand is the risk premium, and what they are\\nworth today, which is called their “present value,” is determined by the discount\\nrate.1\\nHow these four determinants change drives how investment returns\\nchange. Tell me what each of these determinants is going to do and I can tell\\nyou what the investments are going to do. Knowing this tells me how to connect\\nwhat is happening in the world to what is happening in the markets and vice\\nversa. It also shows me how to balance my investments so that my portfolio\\ndoesn’t have any bias to any environment, which is what produces good\\ndiversi\\x00cation.\\nGovernments in\\x00uence these factors through their \\x00scal and\\nmonetary policies. As a result, interactions between what governments\\nwant to happen and what is actually happening are what drive the\\ncycles.2 For example, when growth and in\\x00ation are too low, central banks\\ncreate more money and credit growth, which creates buying power, which\\ncauses economic growth to pick up at \\x00rst and then, with a lag, in\\x00ation to pick\\nup as well. When central banks constrain money and credit growth, the opposite\\nhappens: economic growth and in\\x00ation both slow down.\\nThere is a di\\x00erence between what central governments and central\\nbanks do in order to drive market returns and economic conditions.\\nCentral governments determine where the money they use comes from\\nand goes to because they can tax and spend, but they can’t create money\\nand credit. Central banks on the other hand can create money and credit\\nbut can’t determine what the money and credit go into in the real\\neconomy. These actions from central governments and central banks in\\x00uence\\nthe purchases and sales of goods, services, and investment assets, driving their\\nprices up or down.To me each investment asset re\\x00ects these drivers in its own way that\\nis logical in light of the e\\x00ects on its future cash \\x00ows. Each investment\\nasset is a building block for a portfolio, and the challenge is to put\\ntogether a portfolio well in light of these things. For example, when growth\\nis stronger than expected, all else being equal, stock prices will likely rise, and\\nwhen growth and in\\x00ation are higher than expected, bond prices will likely fall.\\nMy goal is to put these building blocks together in a portfolio that is\\nwell-diversi\\x00ed and tactically tilted based on what is happening or is\\ngoing to happen in the world that is a\\x00ecting these four drivers. These\\nbuilding blocks can be broken out by country, by environmental bias, and all the\\nway down to the level of individual sectors and companies. When this concept is\\nput into a well-balanced portfolio, it looks like the following graphic. It is\\nthrough this lens that I look at the history of events, the history of the markets,\\nand the behavior of portfolios.\\nI understand that my approach is di\\x00erent from that of most investors\\nfor two reasons. First, most investors don’t look for historically analogous\\nperiods because they think history and old investment returns are largely\\nirrelevant to them. Second, they don’t look at investment returns through the\\nlens I just described. I believe that these perspectives give me and Bridgewater a\\ncompetitive advantage, but it’s up to you to take or leave them as you like.Most investors base their expectations on what they have experienced in their\\nlifetimes and a few more diligent ones look back in history to see how their\\ndecision-making rules would have worked back to the 1950s or 1960s. There are\\nno investors I know and no senior economic policy makers I know—and I know\\nmany and I know the best—who have any excellent understandings of what\\nhappened in the past and why. Most investors who look at longer-term returns\\nlook at those in the US and the UK (the countries that won World War I and\\nWorld War II) as being representative. That is because there are not many stock\\nand bond markets that survived World War II. But these countries and time\\nperiods are not representative because of their survivorship bias. In looking at\\nthe returns of the US and the UK, one is looking at uniquely blessed countries in\\nthe uniquely peaceful and productive time that is the best part of the Big Cycle.\\nNot looking at what happened in other countries and in times before yields a\\ndistorted perspective.\\nReasoning logically from what we know about Big Cycles, when we extend\\nour perspective just a few decades further back and look at what happened in\\ndi\\x00erent places, we get a shockingly di\\x00erent perspective. I’m going to show you\\nthis because I think you should have it.\\nIn the 35 years before 1945, virtually all wealth was destroyed or con\\x00scated\\nin most countries, and in some countries many capitalists were killed or\\nimprisoned because of anger at them when the capital markets and capitalism\\nfailed along with other aspects of the old order. If we look at what happened\\nover the past few centuries, we see that such extreme boom/bust cycles\\nhappened regularly—there were regular cycles of capital and capitalist boom\\nperiods (such as the Second Industrial Revolution and the Gilded Age that\\nhappened in the late 19th and early 20th centuries) that were followed by\\ntransition periods (like the 1900–10 period of rising internal con\\x00ict and rising\\ninternational con\\x00ict over wealth and power) that led to great con\\x00ict and\\neconomic bust periods (similar to those that happened between 1910 and 1945).\\nWe can also see that the cause/e\\x00ect relationships that were behind the\\nmovements of those boom and bust periods are now more aligned with the late-\\ncycle bust and restructuring periods than the early-cycle boom and building\\nperiods.My goal was simply to see and try to understand what happened in\\nthe past and do a good job of showing it to you. That is what I will now try\\nto do. I will start in 1350, though the story begins long before.\\nTHE BIG CYCLE OF CAPITALISM AND\\nMARKETS\\nUp until around 1350, lending with an interest rate was prohibited by\\nboth Christianity and Islam—and in Judaism it was banned within the\\nJewish community—because of the terrible problems it caused, with\\nhuman nature leading people to borrow more than they could pay back, which\\ncreated tensions and often violence between borrowers and lenders. As a result\\nof this lack of lending, currency was “hard” (gold and silver). A century or so\\nlater, in the Age of Exploration, explorers went around the world collecting gold\\nand silver and other hard assets to make more money. That’s how the greatest\\nfortunes were built at the time. The explorers and those who backed them split\\nthe pro\\x00ts. It was an e\\x00ective incentive-based system for getting rich.\\nThe alchemy of lending as we know it today was \\x00rst created in Italy around\\n1350. Rules for lending changed and new types of money were made: cash\\ndeposits, bonds, and stocks that looked pretty much like we know them today.\\nWealth became promises to deliver money—w hat I call “\\x00nancial wealth.”\\nThink about what a huge impact the inventions and developments of bond\\nand stock markets had. Before then, all wealth was tangible. Think about how\\nmuch more “\\x00nancial wealth” was created by creating these markets. To imagine\\nthe di\\x00erence, consider how much “wealth” you would now have if your cash\\ndeposits and stock and bond promises to pay you in the future didn’t exist. You\\nwouldn’t have much at all. You’d feel broke, and you’d behave di\\x00erently—for\\nexample, you’d build up more savings in tangible wealth. That is pretty much\\nwhat it was like before cash deposits, bonds, and stocks were created.\\nWith the invention and growth of \\x00nancial wealth, money was not\\nconstrained by a link to gold and silver. Because money and credit, and withthem spending power, were less constrained, it was common practice for\\nentrepreneurs who came up with good ideas to create companies and borrow\\nmoney and/or sell a piece of those companies by selling stock to get money to\\nbuy what they needed. They could do this because promises to pay became\\nmoney that took the form of journal entries. Around 1350 those who could do\\nthis, most famously the Medici family in Florence, could create money. If you\\ncan create credit—let’s say \\x00ve times as much as there is actual money (which\\nbanks can do)—you can produce a lot of buying power so you don’t need as\\nmuch of the other type of money (gold and silver) anymore. The creation of new\\nforms of money was and still is a kind of alchemy. Those who could create it and\\nuse it—bankers, entrepreneurs, and capitalists—became very rich and\\npowerful.3\\nThis process of expanding \\x00nancial wealth has continued up to today, with\\n\\x00nancial wealth becoming so large that the hard money (gold and silver) and\\nother tangible wealth (e.g., property) have become relatively unimportant. But\\nof course the more promises there are in the form of \\x00nancial wealth the greater\\nthe risk there is that these promises can’t be kept. That’s what makes the classic\\nbig debt/money/economic cycle.\\nThink about how much \\x00nancial wealth there is now relative to real wealth\\nand imagine if you and others who are holding it actually tried to convert it into\\nreal wealth—that is, sell it and buy stu\\x00. It would be like a run on a bank. It\\ncouldn’t happen. The bonds and stocks are too sizable in value relative to what\\nthey could buy. But remember that with \\x00at money the central banks can print\\nand provide the money needed to meet the demand. That is a timeless and\\nuniversal truth.\\nAlso remember that paper money and \\x00nancial assets (e.g., stocks and bonds)\\nthat are essentially promises to pay aren’t of much use; it is only what they buy\\nthat is of use.\\nAs discussed in detail in Chapter 3, when credit is created, buying power\\nis created in exchange for a promise to pay back, so it is near-term\\nstimulating and longer-term depressing. That creates cycles. Throughout\\nhistory the desire to obtain money (by borrowing or selling stock) and the desire\\nto save it (by investing through lending or buying stock) have been in asymbiotic relationship. This has led to growth in the form of buying power\\nand eventually to many more promises to pay than can be delivered and\\nbroken-promises crises in the form of debt-default depressions and stock\\nmarket crashes.\\nThat is when the bankers and capitalists are hanged both \\x00guratively\\nand literally, vast amounts of wealth and lives are wiped out, and vast\\namounts of \\x00at money (money that can be printed and has no intrinsic\\nvalue) are printed to try to relieve the crisis.\\nTHE MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE BIG\\nCYCLE FROM AN INVESTOR’S PERSPECTIVE\\nWhile it would be too burdensome for me and you to go through all the relevant\\nhistory between 1350 and now, I will show you what the picture would have\\nlooked like if you had started investing in 1900. But before I do so I want to\\nexplain how I think about risk because I’m going to highlight these risks in what\\nI show you.\\nAs I see it, investment risk is failing to earn enough money to meet\\nyour needs. It’s not volatility measured by standard deviation, which is the\\nalmost exclusively used measure of risk.\\nTo me, the three biggest risks most investors face are that their\\nportfolios won’t provide the returns needed to meet their spending\\nneeds, that their portfolios will face ruin, and that a large share of their\\nwealth will be taken away (e.g., through high taxes).\\nWhile the \\x00rst two risks sound analogous, they are in fact di\\x00erent because it\\nis possible to have average returns that are higher than required but also\\nexperience one or more periods of devastatingly high losses.\\nTo gain perspective, I imagined that I was dropped into 1900 to see how my\\ninvestments would have done in every decade since. I chose to look at the 10\\ngreatest powers as of 1900 and skip less-established countries, which were more\\nprone to bad outcomes. Virtually any one of these countries was or could havebecome a great, wealthy empire, and they were all reasonable places for one to\\ninvest, especially if one wanted to have a diversi\\x00ed portfolio.\\nSeven of these 10 countries saw wealth virtually wiped out at least\\nonce, and even the countries that didn’t see wealth wiped out had a\\nhandful of terrible decades for asset returns that virtually destroyed\\nthem \\x00nancially. Two of the great developed countries—Germany and Japan,\\nwhich at times one easily could have bet on as being winners—had virtually all\\ntheir wealth and many lives destroyed in the World Wars. I saw that many other\\ncountries had similar results. The US and the UK (and a few others) were the\\nuniquely successful cases, but even they experienced periods of great wealth\\ndestruction.\\nIf I hadn’t looked at these returns in the period before the new world order\\nbegan in 1945, I wouldn’t have seen these periods of destruction. And had I not\\nlooked back 500 years around the world, I wouldn’t have seen that this has\\nhappened repeatedly almost everywhere.\\nThe numbers shown in this table are annualized real returns for each decade,\\nwhich means that for the decade as a whole the losses are about eight times\\ngreater than shown and the gains are about 15 times greater.4\\nA LOOK A T ASSE T RE TURNS A CROSS THE GREA T POWERS\\n(Real Returns, 10-Y ear Window , Ann)\\n\\xa0 UNITED ST ATES GREA T BRI TAIN JAPAN GERM ANY\\n\\xa0 Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash\\n1900–\\n109% 0% 1% 3% 2% 2% 4% 1% 4% 3% \\xa0 2%\\n1910–\\n20-2% -4% -3% -6% -7% -5% 1% -5% -4% -14% -10% -14%\\n1920–\\n3016% 7% 5% 10% 8% 7% -3% 12% 10% -24% -95% -86%\\n1930–\\n400% 7% 3% 1% 5% 1% 6% 4% -1% 7% 11% 6%\\n1940–\\n503% -2% -5% 3% -1% -4% -28% -34% -33% -4% -16% -19%\\xa0 UNITED ST ATES GREA T BRI TAIN JAPAN GERM ANY\\n\\xa0 Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash\\n1950–\\n6016% -1% 0% 13% -1% -1% 27% -1% 5% 26% 5% 2%\\n1960–\\n705% -1% 2% 4% 0% 2% 8% 8% 2% 3% 5% 1%\\n1970–\\n80-2% -1% -1% -4% -3% -3% 3% -2% -1% -7% 4% 0%\\n1980–\\n9013% 9% 4% 16% 8% 5% 19% 9% 4% 10% 6% 3%\\n1990–\\n0014% 6% 2% 12% 8% 5% -7% 9% 2% 13% 7% 3%\\n2000–\\n10-3% 8% 0% 0% 4% 2% -3% 4% 1% -2% 6% 2%\\n2010–\\n2011% 4% -1% 5% 5% -1% 10% 2% 0% 7% 5% -1%\\nA LOOK A T ASSE T RE TURNS A CROSS THE GREA T POWERS\\n(Real Returns, 10-Y ear Window , Ann)\\n\\xa0 FRANCE NETHERL ANDS ITALY\\n\\xa0 Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash\\n1900–\\n101% 3% 2% 5% 1% 1% \\xa0 3% 4%\\n1910–\\n20-7% -8% -6% 1% -6% -3% -9% -8% -6%\\n1920–\\n30-2% -1% -4% 1% 11% 6% -6% -5% -1%\\n1930–\\n40-10% 2% 0% 2% 6% 3% 4% 5% 5%\\n1940–\\n50-20% -22% -23% 2% -3% -6% -13% -30% -30%\\n1950–\\n6017% 0% -2% 14% 0% -2% 20% 2% 1%\\n1960–\\n700% 2% 1% 2% 0% 0% 0% 2% 0%\\xa0 FRANCE NETHERL ANDS ITALY\\n\\xa0 Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash\\n1970–\\n80-2% -3% 0% -3% 2% -2% -13% -8% -1%\\n1980–\\n9016% 9% 5% 16% 7% 5% 15% 4% 6%\\n1990–\\n0013% 10% 5% 20% 7% 4% 9% 15% 6%\\n2000–\\n10-2% 5% 1% -6% 5% 1% -4% 5% 1%\\n2010–\\n207% 6% -1% 8% 5% -1% 3% 8% -1%\\n\\xa0 RUSSI A CHIN A AUSTRI A-HUNGAR Y\\n\\xa0 Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash\\n1900–\\n10-2% 3% 4% 7% 6% 3% 4% 3% 2%\\n1910–\\n20-100% -100% -36% 3% 1% 4% -9% -10% -8%\\n1920–\\n30\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 9% 6% 1% -6% -44% -44%\\n1930–\\n40\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2% -7% -6% \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n1940–\\n50\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 -100% -100% -73% \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n1950–\\n60\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n1960–\\n70\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n1970–\\n80\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n1980–\\n90\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n1990–\\n00\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 RUSSI A CHIN A AUSTRI A-HUNGAR Y\\n\\xa0 Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash Equity Bond Cash\\n2000–\\n1015% \\xa0 -2% 4% \\xa0 1% \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n2010–\\n207% 4% 1% 2% 2% 0% \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n5\\nPerhaps this next chart paints a clearer picture, as it shows what percentage of\\ncountries saw losses of a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio over \\x00ve-year periods.\\nThe following table shows the worst cases of investing in major countries in\\ndetail.

I’m certain that even if I had seen the signs of things\\ncoming that I’m passing along in this book I never would have con\\x00dently\\npredicted such bad outcomes—as noted earlier, seven of 10 countries saw their\\nwealth wiped out. In the early 1900s, even those looking back over the past few\\ndecades would never have seen it coming because there were plenty of reasons to\\nbe optimistic based on what had happened during the second half of the 19th\\ncentury.\\nPeople today often assume that World War I must have been easy to foresee in\\nthe years leading up to it, but that wasn’t the case. Before the war, there had been\\nabout 50 years of almost no con\\x00ict between the world’s major powers. During\\nthose 50 years the world experienced the greatest innovation and productivity\\ngrowth rates it had ever seen, which led to enormous wealth and prosperity.\\nGlobalization was at new highs, with global exports up several multiples in the\\n50 years prior to World War I. Countries were more interconnected than ever.\\nThe US, France, Germany, Japan, and Austria-Hungary were rapidly rising\\nempires, experiencing dizzying technological advancement. The UK was still the\\ndominant global power. Russia was rapidly industrializing. Of those countries\\nshown in the table of worst investor experiences, only China was obviously in\\ndecline. Strong alliances among European powers were seen at the time as a\\nmeans of keeping the peace and maintaining the balance of power. Going into1900 things looked great, except for the fact that wealth gaps and resentments\\nwere increasing and debts had become large.\\nBetween 1900 and 1914 these conditions worsened and international\\ntensions increased. Then came the periods of terrible returns I just described.\\nBut it was worse than just terrible returns.\\nIn addition, the impacts on wealth of wealth con\\x00scations, con\\x00scatory taxes,\\ncapital controls, and markets being closed were enormous. Most investors today\\ndon’t know of such things and consider them implausible because they wouldn’t\\nhave seen them by looking back on the past few decades. The following table\\nshows in which decades these events occurred. Naturally the most severe cases of\\nwealth con\\x00scation came during periods in which there were large wealth gaps\\nand internal con\\x00ict over wealth when economic conditions got bad and/or\\nthere was a war.\\nPERIODS OF WEAL TH CONFISCA TION\\n\\xa0 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\\nUK \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nUSA Yes Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nChina \\xa0 \\xa0 Yes Yes \\xa0 \\xa0\\nGermany \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nFrance \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nRussia Yes Yes Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nAustria-\\nHungar y\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nItaly \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nNetherlands \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nJapan \\xa0 \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n7\\nPERIODS OF STRIC T/RISING CAPI TAL CON TROLS\\n\\xa0 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000\\nUK Yes Yes Yes Yes \\xa0 \\xa0USA Yes Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nChina \\xa0 \\xa0 Yes Yes Yes \\xa0\\nGermany Yes Yes Yes Yes \\xa0 \\xa0\\nFrance Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0\\nRussia Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\\nAustria-\\nHungar yYes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nItaly \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nNetherlands \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0\\nJapan \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 Yes \\xa0 \\xa0\\nThe next chart shows the share of major countries that shut their stock\\nmarkets through time.

While these di\\x00erent implementations have di\\x00erent tax\\nimplications (with retirement accounts least impacted), all of them show a\\nsigni\\x00cant impact, especially in real returns, where taxes can erode a signi\\x00cant\\nportion of returns.

This causes “run on the bank”-type debt problems to\\nemerge, which leads to the printing of money to try to relieve the\\nproblems of debt defaults and falling stock market prices, which leads to\\nthe devaluation of money and in turn to \\x00nancial wealth going down\\nrelative to real wealth, until the real (in\\x00ation-adjusted) value of\\n\\x00nancial assets returns to being low relative to tangible wealth. Then the\\ncycle begins again. That is a very simpli\\x00ed description, but you get the idea—\\nduring the downwave in this cycle there are negative real returns of \\x00nancial\\nassets relative to real assets and there are bad times. It is the anti-capital, anti-\\ncapitalist part of the cycle that continues until the opposite extreme is reached.\\nThis cycle is re\\x00ected in the following two charts. The \\x00rst shows the\\nvalue of total \\x00nancial assets relative to the total value of real assets. The\\nsecond shows the real return of money (i.e., cash). I use US numbers ratherthan global numbers because they are the ones that are most continuous since\\n1900. As you can see, when there is a lot of \\x00nancial wealth relative to\\nreal wealth it reverses and real returns of \\x00nancial wealth, especially cash\\nand debt assets (like bonds), are bad. That is because interest rates and\\nreturns for debt holders have to be low and bad in order to provide the\\nrelief to the debtors who have too much debt and in order to try to\\nstimulate more debt growth as a way of stimulating the economy. This is\\nthe classic late-cycle part of the long-term debt cycle. It occurs when printing\\nmore money is used to reduce debt burdens and new debts are created to\\nincrease purchasing power. This devalues the currency relative to other\\nstoreholds of wealth and relative to goods and services. Eventually as the value\\nof \\x00nancial assets declines until they become cheap relative to real assets,\\nthe opposite extreme is reached and reverses, which is when peace and\\nprosperity return, the cycle goes into its up phase, and \\x00nancial assets\\nhave excellent real returns.\\nAs explained earlier, during periods of the devaluation of money, hard\\nmoney and hard assets rise in value relative to cash. For example, the next\\nchart shows that periods when the value of the classic 60/40 stock/bond\\nportfolio declined were periods when gold prices rose. I am not saying\\nanything about gold being a good or bad investment. I am simply describing\\neconomic and market mechanics and how they have been manifest in past\\nmarket movements and investment returns for the purpose of sharing my\\nperspective on what happened and what could happen and why.\\nOne of the most important questions investors need to regularly ask\\nthemselves is whether the amount of interest that is being paid more\\nthan makes up for the devaluation risk they face.\\nThe classic big debt/money/capital markets cycle, which has repeated\\nthrough time and in all places and is re\\x00ected in the charts I just showed you, is\\nseen in the relative values of 1) real/tangible money and real/tangible wealth and\\n2) \\x00nancial money and \\x00nancial wealth. Financial money and \\x00nancial wealth\\nare valuable only to the extent that they get you the real money and real wealth\\nthat have real (i.e., intrinsic) value. The ways these cycles have always worked is\\nthat, in their rising phases, the amounts of \\x00nancial money and \\x00nancial wealth\\n(i.e., created debt and equity assets) are increased relative to the amounts of real\\nmoney and real wealth that they are claims on. They are increased because a) it is\\npro\\x00table for those capitalists who are in the business of creating and selling\\n\\x00nancial assets to produce and sell them, b) increasing money, credit, and other\\ncapital market assets is an e\\x00ective way for policy makers to create prosperity\\nbecause it funds demand, and c) it creates the illusion that people are wealthierbecause the stated values of \\x00nancial investments go up when the value of the\\nmoney and debt assets goes down. In this way central governments and central\\nbankers have always created many more claims on real money and real wealth\\nthan could ever be turned in for real wealth and real money.\\nIn the rising parts of the cycle, stocks, bonds, and other investment assets go\\nup as interest rates go down because falling interest rates make asset prices rise,\\nall else being equal. Also putting more money in the system raises the demand\\nfor \\x00nancial assets, which lowers risk premiums. When these investments go up\\nbecause of lower interest rates and more money in the system, that makes them\\nseem more attractive at the same time as interest rates and the future expected\\nreturns of \\x00nancial assets are going down. The more outstanding claims there\\nare relative to what there are claims on, the more risk there is. This should be\\ncompensated for by a higher interest rate, but it typically isn’t because at that\\nmoment conditions seem good and memories of debt and capital market crises\\nhave faded.\\nThe charts that I showed you before to convey the cycles would not be\\ncomplete in painting the picture without some interest rate charts. Interest rates\\nare shown in the next four charts that go back to 1900. They show real (i.e.,\\nin\\x00ation-adjusted) bond yields, nominal (i.e., not in\\x00ation-adjusted) bond\\nyields, and nominal and real cash rates for the US, Europe, and Japan at the time\\nof my writing. As you can see they were much higher and now they are very low.\\nReal yields of reserve currency sovereign bonds, at the time of my writing this,\\nare near the lowest ever, and nominal bond yields are around 0 percent, also near\\nthe lowest ever. As shown real yields of cash are even lower, though not as\\nnegative as they were in the 1930–45 and 1915–20 great monetization periods.\\nNominal cash yields are near the lowest ever.What does this mean for investing? The purpose of investing is to have\\nmoney in a storehold of wealth that one can convert into buying power at a later\\ndate. When one invests, one gives a lump-sum payment for payments in the\\nfuture. Let’s look at what that deal, as of this writing, looks like. If you give $100\\ntoday, how many years do you have to wait to get your $100 back and then start\\ncollecting the reward on top of what you gave? In US, Japanese, Chinese, and\\nEuropean bonds you could have to wait roughly 45 years, 150 years, and 30\\nyears9 respectively to get your money back (likely getting low or nil nominal\\nreturns) and in Europe at the time of this writing you would likely never get\\nyour money back given negative nominal interest rates. However, because you\\nare trying to store buying power you have to take into consideration in\\x00ation. At\\nthe time of this writing, in the US and Europe, you may never get your buying\\npower back (and in Japan it will take over 250 years). In fact, in these countries\\nwith negative real interest rates, you are almost guaranteed to have a lot less\\nbuying power in the future. Rather than get paid less than in\\x00ation, why not\\ninstead buy stu\\x00—any stu\\x00—that will equal in\\x00ation or better? I see a lot of\\ninvestments that I expect to do signi\\x00cantly better than in\\x00ation. The followingcharts show these payback periods for holding cash and bonds in the US, in both\\nnominal and real terms. As shown, it is the longest ever and obviously a\\nridiculous amount of time.\\nCONCLUSION\\nWhat I showed you here was the Big Cycle from an investor’s perspective\\nsince 1900. In looking around the world going back 500 years and in China\\ngoing back 1,400 years I saw basically the same cycles occur repeatedly for\\nbasically the same reasons.\\nAs discussed earlier in the book, the terrible periods in the years prior to the\\n1945 establishment of the new world order are typical of the late Big Cycle\\ntransition stage when revolutionary changes and restructurings occur. While\\nthey were terrible, they were more than matched by terri\\x00c upswings that came\\nafter the painful transition from the old order to the new order. Because these\\nthings have happened many times before, and because I can’t say for sure what\\nwill happen in the future, I can’t invest without having protections against these\\nsorts of things happening and my being wrong.\\n1 The discount rate is the interest rate that one uses to assess what an amount of money in the future is\\nworth today. To calculate it, one compares what amount of money today, invested at that interest rate (i.e.,\\nthe discount rate), would be worth a certain amount at a speci\\x00c time in the future.2 If governments and their systems break down, non-government-directed forces take over, which is a whole\\nother story that I won’t get into now.\\n3 You can see this kind of alchemy at work today in the form of digital currency.\\n4 When compounded over a decade, gains are greater than losses because you keep building o\\x00 of gains;\\nwhereas as you experience losses and approach zero, future percent losses matter less in dollar terms. The\\ncomparison of annualizing gains versus losses represents compounding from 10 percent annualized gains\\nand -5 percent annualized losses on average. At more extreme changes the multipliers change from there.\\n5 For China and Russia, bond data pre-1950 is modeled using hard currency bond returns held as though\\nhedged back to local currency by a domestic investor; stocks and bonds modeled as full default at time of\\nrevolution. Annualized returns assume a full 10-year period even if markets closed during the decade.\\n6 Cases of poor asset returns in smaller countries such as Belgium, Greece, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,\\nSwitzerland, and across the emerging world are excluded from this table. Note that for conciseness the\\nworst 20-year window is shown for each country/time period (i.e., including Germany in 1903–23\\nprecludes including Germany from 1915–35). For our 60/40 portfolios, we assumed monthly rebalancing\\nacross the 20-year window.\\n7 While this diagram is not exhaustive, I include instances where I could \\x00nd clear evidence of each\\noccurring in the 20-year period. For this analysis, wealth con\\x00scation was de\\x00ned as extensive seizure of\\nprivate assets, including large-scale forced, non-economic sales by a government (or revolutionaries in the\\ncase of revolution). Relevant capital controls were de\\x00ned as meaningful restrictions on investors moving\\ntheir money to and from other countries and assets (although this does not include targeted measures\\ndirected only at single countries, such as sanctions).\\n8 Tax impact for 401(k) method applies a 26 percent income tax rate (e\\x00ective average federal tax rate for\\ntop quintile from the Congressional Budget O\\x00ce as of 2017) at the conclusion of each 20-year investment\\nperiod (i.e., tax-free investment growth). Tax impact for brokerage method separately taxes dividends (at the\\nsame 26 percent income tax rate) and capital gains, paying taxes on all capital gains (at a 20 percent rate)\\nfrom both principal and dividend reinvestment at the conclusion of each 20-year investment period and\\nnetting losses against any gains.\\n9 Based on August 2021 levels of 30-year nominal bond yields (treated as a perpetuity).PART II\\nHOW THE WORLD H AS\\nWORKED O VER THE L AST\\n500 YEARSCHAPTER 8\\nTHE LAST 500 YEARS IN A TINY\\nNUTSHELL\\nI In Part I, I described how I believe the perpetual-motion machine works. In\\nPart II, I will show you what this perpetual-motion machine has produced over\\nthe last 500 years of history. Just as I did in Part I, I’ll start by conveying\\neverything in a tiny nutshell. This chapter will set the stage for the remaining\\nchapters of Part II, which will cover in detail how the Big Cycle played out in the\\nDutch, British, American, and Chinese cases. Finally, in Part III, I will attempt\\nto squint into the future by sharing with you what my model says about a\\nnumber of the leading countries today. But before we get there, we need to go\\nback to 1500 to get a better picture of what the world was like when this story\\nbegins.\\nTHE WORLD IN 1500\\nThe world was very di\\x00erent in 1500 yet it operated the same way it does now.\\nThat’s because while things have evolved a lot since 1500, they’ve done so in the\\nsame ways they always have, with evolutionary uptrends producing\\nadvancements and big cycles creating swings and bumps around the uptrends.\\nA few of the most important ways that the world was di\\x00erent in 1500 were:The World Was Much “Bigger” Then. Five hundred years ago one could\\ntravel about 25 miles in a day on horseback. Today it is possible to travel to the\\nother side of the world in the same amount of time. The Apollo astronauts\\ntraveled to the moon and back much faster than it took a traveler to get from\\nParis to Rome in 1500. As a result, the geographic areas of relevance—e.g., who\\ncould impact whom—were much smaller so the world seemed much bigger.\\nEurope was one world, Russia was another, and China and the areas around it\\nwere an even more remote world. States that in retrospect seem tiny and\\nnumerous did not seem that way at all at the time. Because national boundaries\\ndidn’t exist as they do today, there were almost constant \\x00ghts with neighbors\\nover wealth and power in their neighborhoods.\\nBut in 1500, that picture was changing quickly. The European powers were\\nwell into their Age of Exploration, which was led by the Portuguese and the\\nSpanish and brought them into contact with faraway empires. Like all periods of\\ngreat evolution, the Age of Exploration was enabled by technological\\ndevelopments that could make people rich—in this case, the invention of ships\\nthat could travel the world to accumulate riches by trading with and taking\\nwealth from those who the explorers encountered. At the time, wealthy rulers\\nfunded the expeditions in exchange for a share of the bounty that the explorers\\nbrought back with them.\\nCountries Didn’t Exist—Instead, Territories Were Run by Families. Back\\nin 1500, there were no sovereign states with borders and ruling orders. They\\nhadn’t been invented yet. Instead there were big family estates called\\nkingdoms and dynasties run by kings and emperors that almost\\nconstantly fought with their neighbors for wealth and power. When a\\nkingdom conquered, grew, and encompassed enough area, it was called an\\nempire. Because the ruling order was centered around families, kingdoms and\\ndynasties at that time could inherit other lands if their rulers died and there was\\nno closer relative, similar to how one would inherit property or a family\\ncompany today. Arranged marriages were logical ways the empire could stay in\\nthe hands of a tighter family group rather than branching o\\x00 and dissipating\\nover the generations.Religions and Religious Leaders Were Much More Powerful—and\\nScience as We Know It Today Didn’t Exist. In most of the world, the elites\\n(i.e., that small percentage of the population who had most of the wealth and\\npower) consisted of monarchs who supposedly gained their power from the\\ndivine, the clergy who represented the divine, and the landowning nobles who\\noversaw the peasants and largely treated them like oxen working the land. The\\nmonarchs had ministers, bureaucracies, and militaries that controlled and\\ndefended their territories for them.\\nThough the Europeans and the Chinese were on opposite sides of the world\\nand had virtually no contact with each other, they operated in essentially the\\nsame way, though China’s institutions were bigger, more developed, and less\\nreligious than Europe’s.\\nThe World Was Much Less Egalitarian. The ideas that a) all people should be\\ntreated equally and b) judged by the law didn’t exist at the time. This was true\\nboth within kingdoms and between them; in both cases, power through arms\\nand violence ruled the day. Up until the 1300s and 1400s, serfdom (i.e., peasants\\nbeing essentially treated as the property of their rulers) existed in most of\\nWestern Europe, which meant that the only way for most people to assert their\\npower was through revolt. While this had largely changed by 1500, the rights\\na\\x00orded to common people remained weak until the Enlightenment in the\\n1700s.\\nTHE WORLD’S EMPIRES IN 1500\\nEurope\\nThe Habsburg family dynasty controlled Spain and all the\\nterritories that Spain controlled plus a collection of territories that\\nformed the Holy Roman Empire. This included parts of what wenow call the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Austria. It\\nwas the Western world’s most powerful empire.\\nThe Valois (later Bourbon) family dynasty, which was the main rival\\nto the Habsburgs, controlled France. This led to a lot of \\x00ghting\\nbetween the families.\\nThe Tudor dynasty controlled England, which was not yet an\\nimportant force in Europe though it was growing in strength.\\nFlorence, Venice, and Milan, which were frequently run as republics\\nwith prominent families, were where the action was. Most of the\\n\\x00nancial, commercial, intellectual, and artistic innovation coming out of\\nEurope in 1500 originated in these states. They were very rich and played a\\ncentral role in shaping Europe and the Western world at this time and for\\ncenturies to come because of the revolutionary ideas they fostered, ideas I\\nwill explore in more detail later.\\nThe Papal States were run by the pope and the Catholic Church.\\nThroughout Christian Europe, relationships between monarchs, nobles,\\nand the church followed the typical formula of elites working in mutually\\nsupportive ways to drive the ruling orders to their bene\\x00t. As a result of\\nthis, the church acquired vast wealth, which it got mostly from poor\\npeasants who gave money to the church (through the system of tithes) and\\nworked without pay on church agricultural lands.\\nThe Rurik dynasty, and later the Romanovs, ruled Russia, which was\\na peripheral power at the time and seemed remote to Europeans.\\nThe Ottoman Empire, named after its ruling family, was centered in\\nConstantinople, which it had conquered in 1453.\\nAdditionally there were many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of\\nfamily-run states across Europe. They fought all the time because each had to\\nconstantly defend and \\x00ght one’s neighbors. Allies and enemies were always\\nimportant and constantly changing. This map shows the major powers in\\nEurope in 1550. There were many more small states we couldn’t \\x00t on this map.Asia\\nThe Ming Dynasty controlled almost all of China and was the most\\nadvanced and powerful empire in the world. Like European empires, it\\nwas family-controlled with an emperor who had the “mandate of\\nheaven.” The emperor oversaw a bureaucracy that was run and protected\\nby ministers and military leaders who worked in symbiotic—though\\nsometimes contentious—relationships with landowning noble families\\nwho oversaw peasant workers. In 1500 the Ming Dynasty was\\napproaching its peak and was leaps and bounds ahead of Europe in\\nwealth, technology, and power. It had enormous cultural and political\\nin\\x00uence all over East Asia and Japan.1\\nAt the time, Confucian scholars were then seen to be near the top of the\\nsocial hierarchy, which helped them get ahead in politics. To get ahead one\\nneeded to study Confucianism in depth and pass highly competitive exams.\\nPolitical decisions were frequently based on ruler’s interpretations of Confucian\\nideals. “Neo-Confucianism,” which was dominant at the time, shifted the focus\\nof the belief system toward a more rational, philosophical, academic, and\\nhumanistic form. This way of thinking, which was practical, evidence-based, and\\nscienti\\x00c, was a key reason China pulled so far ahead of Europe in the Middle\\nAges. At the time, scholars and scientists had signi\\x00cant power, which led to\\nremarkable technological advances (gun powder, the printing press, architecture,\\nand more). Literacy rates were extremely high relative to other places at the time,and China was also advanced in medicine. For example, it had a widespread\\nprogram of \\x00ghting smallpox infection via an early form of vaccination,\\ncenturies before Europe. Its \\x00nancial system was relatively well developed with\\nearly forms of corporations and banks, a history of using (and misusing) printed\\nmoney, and relatively sophisticated \\x00nancial markets. And it was militarily very\\nstrong. The Ming Dynasty had the largest navy in the world and a standing army\\nof a million troops.\\nIn his wonderful book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, historian Paul\\nKennedy described it well:\\n“Of all the civilizations of premodern times, none appeared more\\nadvanced, none felt more superior than that of China. Its considerable\\npopulation, 100–130 million compared with Europe’s 50–55 million in\\nthe \\x00fteenth century; its remarkable culture; its exceedingly fertile and\\nirrigated plains, linked by a splendid canal system since the eleventh\\ncentury; and its uni\\x00ed, hierarchic administration run by a well-educated\\nConfucian bureaucracy had given a coherence and sophistication to\\nChinese society which was the envy of foreign visitors.”\\nIronically and typically, the enormity of the Ming Dynasty’s wealth\\nand power is one possible explanation of what eventually led to its fall.\\nBelieving that they did not need anything else, the emperors put an end\\nto China’s exploration of the world, closed its doors, and retired to lives\\nof pleasure, and turned over the running of government to their\\nministers and eunuchs, which led to dysfunctional in\\x00ghting,\\ncorruption, weakness, and vulnerability to attack. There was a shift away\\nfrom pragmatic scienti\\x00c study and innovation toward pedantic scholarship. As\\nwe’ll see in Chapter 12, this helped drive the decline of China relative to Europe.Across the rest of Asia, the story in 1500 was one of fragmentation.\\nIndia was divided among several kingdoms, including the Delhi\\nSultanate in the north and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire in the south.\\nIt was not an empire of note, though it was about to be, as in the 1520s the\\nMughal Empire began its conquest of India, eventually leading it to be among\\nthe world’s most powerful. Likewise Japan in 1500 was divided into many\\nentities, experienced civil war, and was isolated, so it too was not a power\\nof note.\\nThe Middle East\\nThe Ottoman Empire, mentioned before, also came to control much\\nof the Middle East by the mid-1500s, with a key rival in the new\\nSafavid dynasty of Persia (modern-day Iran).\\nThe A mericas\\nThe largest empires were the Aztec Empire centered in Mexico (its\\ncapital, Tenochtitlán, probably had a greater population than any\\ncity in Europe at the time) and the Incan Empire in South America.\\nBut soon the Europeans arrived, devastating both powers andleading to the emergence of new colonies, including the seedlings of\\nwhat would become the United States 276 years later.\\nAfrica\\nA vast continent three times bigger than Europe was divided into\\ndozens of kingdoms, often separated by large, sparsely populated\\nareas. The biggest in the year 1500 was the Songhai Empire in West Africa,\\nwhich had a reputation as a center of trade and Islamic scholarship.\\nThat was the lay of the land in 1500. The world order was about to\\nchange in very big ways.\\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE 1500\\nAs you might imagine, there are far too many important things that have\\nhappened since 1500 for me to \\x00t into this tiny nutshell. However, I can\\nhit the highlights of the story of how the world changed from 1500 until\\nnow, with an emphasis on the key themes and shifts I will be expanding\\non in the following chapters. The most important changes were the\\nchanges in thinking that led to people changing behaviors, particularly\\nabout how wealth and power should be shared. They were what made the\\nstory transpire as it did. It is easy to identify the biggest periods of change\\nbecause they are generally called “revolutions” and “ages” (though sometimes\\nthey are called other things).\\nWhen reading this short summary of the last 500 years, notice both\\nthe evolutions and the cycles. You will see that there were both 1) several\\nrevolutions in ways of thinking that led to tremendous evolution and\\nprogress over hundreds of years and 2) many cycles of peaceful and\\nprosperous periods alternating with depressions and wars that marked\\nthe ends of old orders and beginnings of new ones.The Commer cial Re volution (1100s–1500s)\\nThe Commercial Revolution was the move away from a solely\\nagriculture-based economy to one that included trade in a variety of\\ngoods. This evolution began in the 12th century, and by 1500, it was\\ncentered in the Italian city-states due to a con\\x00uence of two factors that\\nenabled them to become terri\\x00cally wealthy. First, the wars between Christian\\nEurope and the Ottoman Empire signi\\x00cantly slowed land trade (especially for\\nspices and luxuries) between Europe and the rest of the world, which created a\\nsigni\\x00cant opening for maritime trade. Second, a number of Italian city-states\\ndeveloped republican governments modeled after the Roman Republic. Their\\ngovernments were more inventive and responsive than those in the rest of\\nEurope, which allowed a strong merchant class to develop.\\nVenice was a prime example of this, as its governance system was designed\\nwith multiple checks and balances to ensure that there was a more meritocratic\\napproach to government than existed in the rest of Europe. Venice’s leader—\\ncalled the doge—did not have the right to name a successor and was restricted\\nfrom bringing family members into government. New doges were chosen by\\nvote by a series of committees whose members, in some cases, were chosen by lot\\nfrom among several hundred aristocratic families. The Italians produced well-\\nfunctioning capital markets, supported by new advances in bookkeeping and\\nimpartial institutions to enforce contracts. While private and government\\nborrowing weren’t new, leading up to 1500, they tended to take place as bilateral\\ndeals between wealthy citizens, and defaults on creditors (or the expulsion and\\neven execution of them) were extremely common. Because those who made\\nmoney from trade—the merchant class—could bene\\x00t from a well-functioning\\n\\x00nancial system in which savings could be put into investments that fueled\\nproductivity, they created a number of \\x00nancial innovations, including credit\\nmarkets.\\nWith the proceeds from trade \\x00owing in and a need for standardized coinage,\\ncoins minted in the Italian city-states, especially Florence’s gold \\x00orin, were of\\nsolid value, were well-recognized as such, and, as a result, began to be accepted as\\nglobal currencies. On the basis of their solid currencies, these city-statesdeveloped e\\x00ective lending and a publicly traded bond market. Venice\\nestablished a perpetual bond early in the 12th century with a 5 percent coupon\\nthat the government would either issue (i.e., borrow) or purchase back\\ndepending on the \\x00nances/needs of the time. Venice’s merchants owned the\\nbonds and had signi\\x00cant in\\x00uence on the government, so default could only be\\na last resort. The centuries in which the bond existed without defaults gave\\nlenders con\\x00dence in it and institutions for trading bonds in secondary markets\\nmade it a liquid form of investment.\\nThe ability to borrow quickly at reasonable rates was an enormous\\nboon to Venice. Though Venice eventually defaulted after losing a series of wars\\naround 1500, liquid bond markets caught on elsewhere including in the\\nNetherlands and in the UK.\\nThe Renaissance (1300s–1600s)\\nA new way of thinking in many respects modeled after the ancient\\nGreeks and Romans started in Italian city-states around 1300 and passed\\nthrough Europe until the 1600s, in a period known as the Renaissance.\\nRenaissance thinkers made a big pivot toward using logical reasoning instead of\\ndivine intention as the way to explain how the world works. This shift\\ncontributed to dizzyingly fast discoveries that led to artistic and technological\\nadvances in Europe. It began in the city-states of northern Italy where the\\nCommercial Revolution had created riches that led to advances in trade,\\nproduction, and banking enabled by intellectualism and creativity. The\\nRenaissance was one of history’s greatest cases of a self-reinforcing cycle I\\ndescribed in Chapter 5: peaceful periods in which creativity and\\ncommerce reinforce each other to produce an economic boom and great\\nadvancements.\\nIn the middle of it, and propelling it forward, were people and families like\\nthe Medici, who were merchants and bankers, not feudal kings. They used their\\nriches to support the arts, architecture, and science.2 Alongside the \\x00ourishing\\nin art and architecture were huge advances in science, technology, and business.Knowledge and ideas spread rapidly because of the invention of the\\nprinting press in the mid-15th century.\\nBy the way, many of the European Renaissance innovations had\\nalready been in place in China for centuries because the Chinese\\ndiscovered the key elements to produce it—e.g., the printing press, the\\nscienti\\x00c method, and the meritocratic placements of people in jobs—\\nmuch earlier. One can think of China’s Neo-Confucianism, described earlier,\\nas being like China’s Renaissance because, as in Europe’s Renaissance, it led to\\nmore logic- and evidence-based thinking and more inventive rather than\\nreligious worldviews.\\nAs the new ideas spread across Europe in the late 16th and early 17th\\ncenturies, luminaries such as Shakespeare and Francis Bacon in England,\\nDescartes in France, and Erasmus in the Netherlands had broad impacts. Living\\nstandards rose dramatically, though much more for the elites than for peasants.\\nIn Italy, this period of relative peace and prosperity eventually led to excesses,\\ndecadence, and decline as the city-states became less competitive and their\\n\\x00nancial conditions deteriorated.\\nThe Age of Explor ation and Colonialism (1400s–1700s)\\nThe Age of Exploration began in the 1400s when Europeans traveled all\\nover the world in search of wealth, creating widespread contact between\\nmany di\\x00erent peoples for the \\x00rst time and beginning to shrink the\\nworld. It roughly coincided with the Renaissance because thetechnological marvels of the Renaissance translated into advancements in\\nshipbuilding and navigation, and the riches that those ships brought\\nback \\x00nanced further Renaissance advancements.\\nRuling families supported these money-making explorations and split\\nthe pro\\x00ts with explorers. For example, Henry the Navigator, the brother of\\nthe head of the Portuguese royal family, sponsored some of the earliest voyages\\nand established a trading empire in Africa and Asia. Spain followed suit, swiftly\\nconquering and colonizing signi\\x00cant portions of the Western Hemisphere,\\nincluding the precious-metal-rich Aztec and Incan empires. Though Portugal\\nand Spain were rivals, the unexplored world was huge, and when they had\\ndisputes, they were successfully mediated. Spain’s integration into the Habsburg\\nEmpire and its control over highly pro\\x00table silver mines made it stronger than\\nPortugal in the 1500s, and for a roughly 60-year period starting in the late 1500s\\nthe Habsburg king ruled Portugal as well. Both translated their wealth into\\ngolden ages of art and technology. The Spanish Empire grew so large it became\\nknown as “the empire on which the sun never sets”—an expression that would\\nlater be used to describe the British Empire.\\nAs European nations found ways to make their explorations more\\npro\\x00table, the rise of global trade transformed their economies. Most\\nnotably, the \\x00ow of new riches (particularly silver) to Europe fueled a rise in\\nprices for basic goods and services. Referred to as the Spanish Price Revolution,\\nEurope went from hundreds of years of steady prices to a doubling of\\nprices every few decades, a reminder of how big shifts can have economic\\nimpacts that seem unimaginable based on one’s most recent experiences.\\nEventually this push toward exploration led Europe to trade with—\\nand exploit—Asia, most notably China, Japan, and the Indian\\nsubcontinent. The Portuguese were the \\x00rst of these explorers to\\napproach China in 1513, though other European explorers like Marco\\nPolo had been in contact before. Europeans were dazzled by the quality of\\nChinese porcelain, silk, and other goods, which became highly sought after, but\\nthe Chinese weren’t interested in buying European goods, which they\\nconsidered inferior. However they eagerly accepted silver, which was money in\\nChina as well as in Europe, as payment. As we’ll cover later, China struggled for\\ncenturies with shortages of the precious metals it needed to have a su\\x00cient\\nsupply of money. However the Europeans didn’t have enough silver to trade and\\nthe Chinese weren’t interested in other goods, which eventually led to the\\nOpium Wars and other interesting stories that we will explore later.\\nChina’s Ming Dynasty had its own version of the Age of Exploration\\nbut abandoned it. Starting in the early 1400s, Ming Dynasty Emperor Yongle\\nempowered his most trusted admiral, Zheng He, to lead seven major naval\\nexpeditions—“treasure voyages”—around the world. Though not colonizing\\nexpeditions (and historians debate the extent to which they were commercial),\\nthese naval missions helped project China’s power abroad. Yongle’s navy was the\\nlargest and most sophisticated in the world, featuring larger and better-\\nconstructed ships than any country in Europe would produce for at least a\\ncentury.\\nChina’s international in\\x00uence, as indicated by the number of foreign cities\\nengaged in formal tributary relationships with the mainland, increased rapidly.\\nHowever, the Ming emperors chose to end these voyages and pulled the empire\\ninto itself. It remains a matter of conjecture whether that is because Yongle’s\\nmilitary and naval expeditions were expensive or because the emperors believed\\nthat they had all they needed within China so there was no need for this\\nexploration.The result of this pullback was an Age of Isolationism in China and in\\nJapan as well, where it was called S a k o k u. For the next several centuries,\\nChina and Japan broadly moved away, in \\x00ts and starts, from openness\\ntoward foreigners and toward distance and isolation.\\nThe Reformation (1517–1648)\\nBeginning in the 1500s in Europe, Protestant religious movements\\ninitiated a revolution against the Roman Catholic Church, which\\ncontributed to a series of wars and the bringing down of the then-\\nexisting European order. As previously explained, at the time, the\\nexisting order consisted of monarchs, nobles, and the church in symbiotic\\nrelationships. The Reformation took aim at the power and corruption of the\\nRoman Catholic Church and sought an independent religion in which people\\ndealt with God directly rather than one mediated by the church’s rules. At the\\ntime, many Catholic bishops and other senior clergy lived like princes in palaces\\nand the church sold “indulgences” (a supposed reduction in time people would\\nhave to spend in purgatory). The Roman Catholic Church was a nation as\\nmuch as it was a religion, directly governing a sizable share of modern Italy (the\\nPapal States).\\nThe Reformation started in 1517, when Martin Luther published his Ninety-\\nFive Theses, challenging the papal monopoly on the interpretation of the Bible\\nand on papal power in general. When he refused to recant his ideas, he was\\ndeclared a heretic and excommunicated. His ideas—and those of other\\ntheologians—nonetheless took hold in large parts of Europe, thanks to thepolitical support of key nobles, as well as the new printing press technology.\\nThat move, together with the usual constant \\x00ghting for power, broke\\ndown the existing European world order.\\nIn virtually all the major Christian powers, the immediate impact of the\\nReformation was increased internal con\\x00ict and instability, and the instability\\nextended between countries too. The Wars of Religion were intertwined\\nwith the wars against the existing orders and existing elites. They\\nincluded an extended civil war in France in which an estimated 3 million\\npeople died and later contributed to an extended civil war in the UK. In\\nthe end, the Reformation led to Protestants earning substantial rights\\nand freedoms. It also undermined the power of the Holy Roman Empire\\nand the Habsburgs, left Germany with deep divisions that would\\ncontinue to build through the end of the incredibly brutal Thirty Years’\\nWar in the mid-1600s, and led to civil wars for over a hundred years. As\\nis typical, the big war led to a new order, which was followed by a period\\nof peace and prosperity.\\nThe New W orld Or der F ollowing the Thir ty Years’ W ar (1648)\\nOn its surface, the Thirty Years’ War pitted Protestant countries against\\nCatholic ones; however, the full story was more complicated with wider\\ngeopolitical interests related to wealth and power playing a role of who\\nlined up with whom. At the end of the war the new order was laid out at\\nthe Peace of Westphalia. The most important breakthroughs that came\\nfrom it were the establishment of geographic borders and the sovereign\\nrights of the people within those borders to decide what happens in their\\ndomains. Like most periods after major wars and the establishment of\\nnew orders, there was an extended time of peace between countries, with\\nthe Dutch emerging from the chaos as the leading global economic\\npower. However, the battles for wealth and power—most importantly between\\ndeclining monarchies and their subjects—continued across the continent.\\nThe Inv ention of Capitalism (1600s)Beginning with the Dutch, the development of publicly available and\\npopularly used equity markets allowed savers to e\\x00ectively transfer their\\nbuying power to entrepreneurs who could put that buying power to\\nproductive and pro\\x00table use. This signi\\x00cantly improved the allocation\\nof resources and was stimulative to economies because it produced new\\nbuying power. It also produced the capital markets cycles. While there were\\nmany elements involved in the creation of capitalism, a series of related economic\\nand \\x00nancial developments—most notably the developments of publicly traded\\nstock and bond markets such as the opening of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange\\nin 1602 and the Bank of England’s \\x00rst government bond issuance (to fund the\\nwar with France) in 1694—are associated with it. Along with the advances of the\\nScienti\\x00c Revolution, the invention of capitalism was a key reason behind the\\nshift from slow real GDP growth to the faster growth, as seen in the chart I\\nshowed in Chapter 1. We will explore this innovation and its tremendous impact\\nin more detail in the following chapter.\\nThe Scientiﬁc Re volution (1500s–1600s)\\nThe Scienti\\x00c Revolution was an extension of the Renaissance-era shift\\nfrom \\x00nding truth in religion to \\x00nding truth in logical reasoning and\\nthe Reformation’s drive to question authority and think for oneself.\\nThese factors led to the development of the scienti\\x00c method, which\\nimproved humanity’s understanding of the world, establishing protocols\\nby which scienti\\x00c discoveries could be investigated and proven and\\nushering in many discoveries that raised living standards.\\nThe scienti\\x00c method was pioneered by Francis Bacon in the early 1600s,\\nthough many important advances in astronomy—particularly the work of\\nCopernicus and Galileo—took place earlier, in the 1500s. These discoveries\\nvastly expanded European knowledge about the solar system for the \\x00rst time\\nsince the Greco-Roman period and were paralleled by many others across\\nanatomy, mathematics, physics (e.g., Isaac Newton’s laws of motion), and many\\nother \\x00elds. European governments began to support and sponsor this research,\\nwith the most famous example being the Royal Society in the UK, which wasfounded in 1660 and proved instrumental in promoting the exchange of ideas\\nand discoveries (Newton was its president from 1703 to 1727). Over the\\ncenturies to come, the discoveries of the Scienti\\x00c Revolution helped unleash\\neconomic growth and greater competitiveness for the major European powers,\\nparticularly the UK. The ideas and methods that underpinned the revolution\\nwere applied to more and more \\x00elds through the movement known as the\\nEnlightenment.\\nThe First Industrial Re volution (1700s–1800s)\\nBeginning in the UK in the 1700s, freeing people to be inventive and productive\\nand providing them with capital led many societies to shift to new machine-\\nbased manufacturing processes, creating the \\x00rst sustained and widespread\\nperiod of productivity improvement in thousands of years. These improvements\\nbegan with agricultural inventions that increased productivity, which led to a\\npopulation boom and a secular shift toward urbanization as the labor intensity\\nof farming declined. As people \\x00ocked to cities, industry bene\\x00ted from the\\nsteadily increasing supply of labor, creating a virtuous cycle and leading to shifts\\nin wealth and power both within and between nations. The new urban\\npopulations needed new types of goods and services, which required the\\ngovernment to get bigger and spend money on things like housing, sanitation,\\nand education, as well as on the infrastructure for the new industrial capitalist\\nsystem, such as courts, regulators, and central banks. Power moved into the\\nhands of central government bureaucrats and the capitalists who controlled the\\nmeans of production.\\nGeopolitically, these developments most helped the UK, which pioneered\\nmany of the most important innovations. The UK caught up to the Netherlands\\nin output per capita around 1800, before overtaking them in the mid-19th\\ncentury, when the British Empire approached its peak share of world output\\n(around 20 percent).\\nThe Enlightenment and the Age of Re volutions (1600s–1700s)Also known as the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment was essentially the\\nscienti\\x00c method applied to how humans should behave. This way of\\nthinking became widespread in Europe in the 1700s and 1800s and was\\nan extension of the diminishing of the rights of the monarchy and the\\nchurch and the increasing of the rights of the individual that\\ncharacterized earlier intellectual movements. New \\x00elds like economics\\nexpanded thanks to thinkers like Adam Smith, while \\x00gures like John Locke and\\nMontesquieu pushed political philosophy in new directions. In particular, the\\nEnlightenment ideas of these and other \\x00gures promoted rationality and\\nindividual liberties and undermined monarchic and religious powers, creating a\\nmovement toward overthrowing monarchies known as the Age of Revolutions.\\nThis wave of revolutions included the American, French, Spanish, German,\\nPortuguese, and Italian. As is typical, this era of upheaval led some nations to\\nseek out strong leaders who could bring order to the chaos. In the case of France,\\nthat leader was Napoleon, who changed the course not just of French history\\nbut of European history as he sought to conquer all of Europe. Napoleon was\\nthe classic great benevolent dictator who converted chaos into order and\\nprosperity, and expanded the empire with his military prowess. As is often the\\ncase, he overreached and failed.\\nThe Napoleonic W ars and the New W orld Or der that F ollowed\\n(1803–1815)\\nThe Napoleonic Wars lasted from 1803 to 1815, when Great Britain and\\nits allies defeated Napoleon and his allies. As is usual, the victors got\\ntogether to create a new world order, which was hashed out at the\\nCongress of Vienna. It drew new boundaries to ensure that no European\\npower would become too dominant, based on balance of power concepts\\nthat would avoid war. The British emerged as the world’s leading empire,\\nand as is typical after the war and the establishment of a new order, there\\nwas an extended period of peace and prosperity—the Pax Britannica.\\nWestern P owers Mo ve int o Asia (1800 S)The British and other Western powers brought their gunboats to India,\\nChina, and Japan in the mid-1700s and into the 1800s, causing dramatic\\ndisruptions to the course of their histories. At the time, both China and\\nJapan were isolationist. India was controlled by the Mughal Empire, which\\nhad expanded into a signi\\x00cant power in South Asia but experienced rapid\\ndecline in the 1700s. The Western powers, which were signi\\x00cantly more\\nadvanced militarily at this time, wanted to force trade on all three. The Chinese\\nattempted to \\x00ght the British but lost; the Japanese saw this and opened\\nthemselves for trade after US Commander Matthew Perry sailed four warships\\ninto Tokyo Bay in 1853. These developments led to the eventual fall of the\\nQing Dynasty, the resignation of the Japanese government, and the\\ncontinued control of India by the British. Especially in Japan and China,\\nit also led to the realization that they needed to modernize, which\\nprompted the Meiji Restoration (in Japan) and the Self-Strengthening\\nMovement (in China). This move was very successful in Japan and not\\nsuccessful in China, which continued to su\\x00er in what the Chinese call\\nthe Century of Humiliation.\\nSecond Industrial Re volution (1850s–early 1900s)\\nBeginning in the mid-1800s, a second big wave of innovation took place,\\ncentered at \\x00rst around steam-powered locomotion (e.g., railroads) and then\\nelectricity, telephones, interchangeable manufacturing parts, and other\\ninnovations at the turn of the 20th century. Whereas the First Industrial\\nRevolution was centered on the UK, the Second Industrial Revolution primarily\\nbene\\x00ted the United States. As is typical, this period produced both great\\nwealth and great wealth gaps and excesses in the capital markets, leading\\nto an era known as the Gilded Age in the US.\\nInvention of Communism (1848)\\nThe invention and development of communism in the mid-1800s came as\\na reaction against both capitalism and the wealth gaps it created and the\\nbene\\x00ts of the Industrial Revolutions going more to the owners of thenew technologies than to the workers. Con\\x00icts between communists and\\nthe established powers intensi\\x00ed around the turn of the century and led to a\\nnumber of major revolutions in the 20th century, including in both Russia and\\nChina where communist governments took power.\\nThat brings us to the 20th century, which had two big cycles of boom,\\nbusts, wars, and new orders, the second of which we appear to be in the\\nlate stages of. Because I review these comprehensively in Chapters 10\\nthrough 13, and because they are much more familiar to most readers, I\\nwill end this overview here and dive now into the story of the Dutch and\\nhow they rose to become the \\x00rst global reserve currency empire.\\n1 By the way, the existence of familial relationships in a Chinese dynasty should not be mistaken for loving\\nand caring relationships, as, just like in Europe, \\x00ghts between family members for control of dynasties\\nwere brutal and often to the death.\\n2 The Medici family, who ruled and developed Florence during the period (though Florence technically\\nremained a republic for much of their rule), acquired their wealth and power as business leaders and\\nbankers. The Medici used their wealth, power, and smarts to acquire more wealth and power and to\\ncontribute enormously to the arts and sciences. They also acquired signi\\x00cant political power in Europe.\\nFor example, to gain power and/or to provide public service, four popes came from the Medici family\\nduring their reign. A number of Medici were themselves artists and political leaders who looked to help not\\nonly the rich but also the middle and poorer classes in the city. However, like many multigenerational\\nfamilies and monarchies, after a few generations a weak head of the family and leader of the state, together\\nwith perceived excesses at a time of economic stress, led to a revolution. The Medici lost control of Florence\\non several occasions. While the Medici returned to power over the subsequent three centuries and the\\nRenaissance continued, they struggled and failed in the mid-16th century as a result of wars, changing trade\\nroutes, and bad loan making, which damaged their \\x00nances, and of changes in social norms and political\\npractices.CHAPTER 9\\nTHE BIG CYCLE RISE AND DECLINE OF\\nTHE DUTCH EMPIRE AND THE GUILDER\\nAfter a series of attempted revolts in the mid-1500s, the Dutch, who\\nwere under the control of Habsburg Spain, \\x00nally became powerful\\nenough to gain de facto independence in 1581. From 1625 until their\\ncollapse in 1795, the Dutch gained enough wealth and power to eclipse\\nboth the Habsburgs and China as the world’s richest empire.\\nThe Dutch Empire rose for all the classic reasons explained in earlier\\nchapters, peaking around 1650 in what is now remembered as the Dutch\\nGolden Age. While its small population and territorial footprint prevented it\\nfrom being the dominant military power on the European continent, it more\\nthan made up for that through a combination of economic strength, \\x00nancial\\nsophistication, and a strong navy that could protect its large empire of trading\\nposts and colonies around the world. This allowed its currency, the Dutch\\nguilder, to emerge as the \\x00rst global reserve currency.\\nThe following chart shows the eight powers that fueled the Dutch ascent and\\neventual decline.What the chart doesn’t show is the decline of the prior leading power, the\\nHabsburg Empire, which you can see in the next chart depicting the entire arc of\\nthe Dutch Empire with key events noted. The numbers mark the approximate\\ntimes of the six stages of the internal order cycle.\\nThe story begins with the decline of the Spanish Habsburgs, which initiated the\\n\\x00rst stage of the Dutch Big Cycle.\\nThe T ransition fr om the Spanish/Habsbur g Empir e to the Dutch\\nEmpir eNew empires rise when old ones become weak and decadent. The story of the\\nDutch Empire began when the Habsburg Empire became weak, decadent, and\\noverextended in all the classic ways.\\nFrom 1519 until 1556, the Holy Roman emperor and head of the Habsburg\\nEmpire was Charles V. The union of territories he controlled—w hich included\\nmost of modern-day Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Spain\\n—made the Habsburg Empire the most powerful family empire in Europe.\\nSpain was especially strong1 because of the wealth and power it acquired\\nin the Age of Exploration. The Spanish \\x00eet was clearly the most powerful\\nnavy in Europe. Spanish silver coinage came close to being a reserve currency—it\\nwas used as far a\\x00eld as China. Things began to change around the mid-1500s as\\nthe seeds of decline that were planted in the top phase began to\\ngerminate and a revolutionary shift in power began to brew.\\nThe decline of the Habsburgs happened in many of the classic ways.\\nThere were revolutions against the elites who held wealth and power by\\nthose without them, challenging the existing order. For example, as I\\nexplained in the previous chapter, new religious ideas surfaced in the\\nform of the Reformation, a revolution against the Roman Catholic\\nChurch, which was perceived as decadent and exploitative. At the time, the\\nCatholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire were a rich and powerful\\npolitical force that was integral to the existing order. The revolution started\\nwhen a collection of religious opposition groups known generally as\\nProtestantism challenged the system. Martin Luther published his Ninety-\\nFive Theses in 1517, challenging the papal interpretation of the Bible and papal\\npower in general. When Luther refused to recant, he was declared a heretic and\\nexcommunicated. His ideas nonetheless took hold in large parts of Europe,\\nthanks to the political support of key nobles, as well as Europe’s new printing\\npress technology.\\nThis came at an economically di\\x00cult time, when con\\x00icts were\\nintensifying, leading to instability and terrible civil wars,2 eventually\\nculminating in the brutal Thirty Years’ War in the mid-1600s. Its biggest\\nnegative impact was on the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs.\\nCharles V failed to prevent the revolutionary impacts of the Reformation and\\nwith it the damage to the existing order. He was forced to sign the Peace of\\nAugsburg in 1555, which weakened the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg\\ndynasty. He abdicated and divided his holdings in two: the Holy Roman\\nEmpire, which he passed to his brother Ferdinand, and most of the rest of the\\nHabsburg Empire—most importantly Spain, but also the Netherlands,Belgium, signi\\x00cant portions of Italy, and Spanish colonies abroad—w hich he\\npassed on to his son Philip II. From that point forward, the decline followed the\\nclassic script:\\nThe empire was overextended militarily. Not only did Spain face a\\nlengthy revolt against its unpopular rule in the Netherlands, it also fought\\nwith the Ottoman Empire, various Italian states, the French, and the\\nBritish. These wars were costly and chipped away at the Habsburg family\\ndynasty even before the Thirty Years’ War.\\nTerrible national \\x00nances caused the classic toxic mix of increased\\ntaxation, money printing, and rising debt. Philip II defaulted on debts\\nfour times during his reign.\\nThe lower and middle classes su\\x00ered from rising food prices, which\\nwere increasing at an unprecedented rate from the Spanish Price\\nRevolution.\\nInternal con\\x00ict grew, for all the previously mentioned reasons.\\nLeadership deteriorated. Philip II and his son Philip III preferred lavish\\nliving to governing and ultimately used money printing to cover the large\\nde\\x00cits, which led to high in\\x00ation and economic pain. Those around\\nthem behaved similarly.\\nThis chart shows the value of the most popular commonly circulating coin in\\nsilver terms. Adding cheap base metals to the monetary supply was the popular\\nway to “print” and devalue money at the time. You can see it started in the early\\n1600s.\\nThe events of the 1500s were not the end of the Habsburg Empire, nor even\\nto its claim to control the Netherlands—that wouldn’t happen until the end of\\nthe Thirty Years’ War in 1648. But they did create the conditions that allowed\\nthe Dutch to rise.\\nTHE RISE\\nFrom 1581 until around 1625, the Dutch Empire was built following the\\nclassic steps of a rising empire outlined in Chapter 1. More speci\\x00cally:\\nLed by William the Silent, the Dutch successfully revolted against Spain in\\nthe Eighty Years’ War, which resulted in the Dutch Republic asserting its\\nindependence in 1581. William, who was basically the father of the\\nNetherlands, was a skilled military commander and united the various\\nDutch provinces against the Spanish.\\nWhile the Spanish and the Dutch continued to \\x00ght over the subsequent\\ndecades, the Dutch were able to gain independence and the seeds were\\nsown for the rise of a more uni\\x00ed Dutch Republic (particularly as Philip\\nII cut o\\x00 trade with the Dutch, forcing them to expand abroad on their\\nown).\\nBecause the republic was set up to allow each of the underlying\\nprovinces to maintain a high degree of sovereignty, the rise of the\\nDutch Empire was driven by a collective of statesmen rather than by\\na single monarch or leader. Though nobles held the most important\\nroles, this system created checks and balances and a partnership that proved\\ne\\x00ective.\\nDutch values and culture emphasized education, saving, merit, and\\ntolerance.\\nThe break from Spain allowed the Dutch to create a more open and\\ninventive society.The Dutch invented ships that could go around the world to collect\\nriches, capitalism that could \\x00nance these and other productive\\nendeavors, and many more breakthroughs that made them rich and\\npowerful. The Dutch created the world’s \\x00rst mega-corporation, the\\nDutch East India Company, which accounted for about one-third of\\nworld trade.3 Dutch openness to new ideas, people, and technology\\nhelped them rise quickly.\\nTo support trade the Dutch government increased military\\ninvestments, which allowed the country to control still more trade by\\nholding o\\x00 the British in a number of military con\\x00icts.\\nThe Dutch also created the world’s \\x00rst reserve currency other than\\ngold and silver, the Dutch guilder, supported by an innovative\\nbanking and currency system put into place via the establishment of\\nthe Bank of Amsterdam.4\\nAs a result of these classic and sound fundamental steps, the Dutch\\nbecame rich—income per capita in the Netherlands rose to over twice\\nthat of most other European powers. The Dutch continued to invest\\nheavily in education and infrastructure to build on their successes. Dutch\\nliteracy rates reached twice the world average. They continued to develop their\\ncapital markets and Amsterdam became the world’s most important\\n\\x00nancial center. The Dutch did all of this with a population of only 1–2\\nmillion people.\\nThe following charts provide some perspective on the unique nature of\\nDutch education, innovation, and trade in the 1600s and the impact these forces\\nhad on Dutch incomes, all of which we will explore later in this chapter.\\nIn short, the Dutch were superbly educated people who were very\\nhardworking and inventive—in fact, they came up with about a quarter of all\\nmajor inventions in the world when they were at their peak, a spike that began\\nshortly before Dutch independence from Spain.To reiterate, the two most important inventions they came up with\\nwere 1) uniquely e\\x00ective sailing ships that could take them all around\\nthe world, which, with the military skills they acquired from the \\x00ghting\\nthey did in Europe, allowed them to collect great riches, and 2) the\\ncapitalism that fueled these endeavors.\\nThe Capital Mark ets Cy cle of the Dutch\\nThe Dutch invented capitalism as we know it. This was great for the\\nDutch and great for the world, but like most great inventions, it brought\\nwith it some potentially deadly consequences. While production, trade, and\\nprivate ownership had existed before, the ability of large numbers of people\\nto collectively buy ownership in money-making endeavors through\\npublic equity markets did not exist. The Dutch created that when they\\ninvented the world’s \\x00rst publicly listed company (the Dutch East India\\nCompany) and the \\x00rst stock exchange in 1602.\\nLike most inventions, these capital market developments arose out of\\nnecessity and self-interest. The voyages across the world in search of new trade\\nroutes were risky ventures, so it made sense for merchants to sell some of the risk\\nassociated with the voyage to others in exchange for a share of the future pro\\x00ts.\\nAt the time the Dutch introduced equity shares in their voyages in the mid-\\n1500s, it was revolutionary. Until 1600, these shares were held by only a small\\nnumber of merchants, largely lacked transparency, and were illiquid, so their\\nattractiveness to outside investors was limited.\\nThe formation of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in August 1602 and\\nthe listing of the Dutch East India Company spread share ownership\\nmuch wider (more than one in 50 Dutch adults owned shares), and the\\nexchange’s clear rules about ownership and transfer of shares made the market\\nmuch more transparent. The Dutch East India Company was an equally\\nrevolutionary invention. The world’s \\x00rst transnational corporation, it\\nhad many of the features you see in companies today—shareholders, a\\ncorporate logo, a board of directors, etc. Capital markets enabled investors to\\nsave, merchants to raise funds, and everyone to have a liquid market in whichtransfers of capital could happen easily and e\\x00ciently, fueling a new era of\\nwealth accumulation. At their peak in the early 1700s, Dutch East India\\nCompany dividends accounted for nearly $1 out of every $100 of total Dutch\\nGDP.\\nImportantly, the Dutch outcompeted the Spanish and the Portuguese, which\\nled them to win the main prize—a higher share of the trading between Europe\\nand Asia, particularly China and Indonesia, which was very pro\\x00table.\\nIn addition to creating an equity market, the Dutch developed an\\ninnovative banking system, which grew rapidly and began to \\x00nance\\ninternational trade for Dutch and non-Dutch merchants. Prior to the\\nDutch banking innovations, the international currency situation was a mess. In\\nthe late 1500s, around 800 di\\x00erent foreign and domestic coins circulated in the\\nNetherlands, many of which were debased (i.e., had a lowered content of\\nprecious metal in the coins) and di\\x00cult to distinguish from counterfeits. This\\ncreated uncertainty over the value of money, which made international trade\\nslower and more expensive.\\nIn 1609, the Bank of Amsterdam was established as an exchange bank to\\nprotect commercial creditors from unreliable commodity money in general\\ncirculation. The Bank of Amsterdam undertook activities that would generate\\nmonetary stability and put the Netherlands’ coinage, the bank’s letters of credit,\\nand the Dutch \\x00nancial system at the center of global \\x00nance. Notably, this\\nbank guilder, though backed by hard currency, was essentially Type 2 money.\\nThat set up the guilder as a true reserve currency, the \\x00rst of its kind.As a result of this system, the guilder remained e\\x00ective as both a medium of\\nexchange and a storehold of wealth. Bank of Amsterdam bills of exchange\\nimproved their status as a reserve currency. Baltic and Russian trade\\nrelied solely on guilders and Bank of Amsterdam bills of exchange for\\npricing and contract settlement.5\\nThe New W orld Or der: The Thir ty Years’ W ar and the P eace of\\nWestphalia\\nThen came the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48). While the Dutch played a relatively\\nminor role in the Europe-wide con\\x00ict, it is worth covering this war in some\\ndetail given its importance to the internal and external orders of Europe more\\nbroadly. It is also a classic case of how internal and external orders work together.\\nAll the classic balance of power dynamics came into play. In this case, the\\nThirty Years’ War was a classic \\x00ght over wealth and power, just a lot longer one.\\nOn one side was the Catholic emperor of Habsburg Austria, who was allied with\\nthe German Catholic territories (most prominently Bavaria), as well as with\\nSpain and the Papal States. On the other side were the German Protestant\\nnobles, allied at di\\x00erent points in time with Denmark, the Netherlands,\\nSweden, and France. The \\x00ghting was about money, religion (Protestants versus\\nCatholics), and geopolitics. The alliances were pretty complex. For example, the\\nFrench monarchy—despite being Catholic and having Cardinal Richelieu6\\ndriving policy—was allied (\\x00rst secretly, then openly) with both Lutheran\\nSweden and largely Calvinist Netherlands. That is because money and\\ngeopolitics mattered more than religious ideologies.The Habsburgs lost the war. That left them in a meaningfully\\nweakened position. The treaty that established the new international order, the\\nPeace of Westphalia, expanded the autonomy of the individual princes of the\\nHoly Roman Empire, further eroding the limited authority of the Austrian\\nemperor over the other states. More importantly, the deal that was cut at\\nWestphalia invented countries as we know them, which is to say it\\nallowed sovereignty of the state with the ability to make choices within\\nits geographic borders (e.g., their religions, their languages, and all their rules)\\nand instituted respect for those boundaries so that no longer would borderless,\\nfree-\\x00owing power grabs occur (without, of course, the understanding that\\nyou’d be starting a major war). The emergence of the concept of states led to\\nnationalism and the pursuit of national interests, which reshaped the concept of\\nthe balance of power between rival states. It also made the religious\\nauthorities much less powerful.\\nThe Peace of Westphalia re\\x00ected what I call the “exhaustion of war,”\\nwhich contributed to a long period of peace and prosperity that\\nfollowed. Like all big wars, the Thirty Years’ War produced devastating losses of\\nlife, property, and wealth. One quarter of the population of Europe died from\\ncombat, disease, or starvation. Because wars are so much more terrible than\\neven those who are eager for them can imagine, they lead to treaties that\\nrede\\x00ne the order and are followed by periods of peace, until the next big\\nwar happens.\\nThe Dutch bene\\x00ted greatly from the new balance of power and\\nperiod of relative stability; probably most importantly, it protected them\\nfrom the threat of Habsburg domination.\\nIt is also the case that \\n wars are devastatin g ﬁnancially; that is true for the winners\\nand much more so for the losers.  For example, France, though a “winner” and only\\nindirectly involved for much of the war, experienced such bad \\x00nancial problems\\nand instability as a result that it was faced with widespread rebellions. The losing\\nHabsburg Empire was even more devastated. Relative to the French and\\nSpanish, the Dutch were less \\x00nancially hurt. They bene\\x00ted from the peace\\nthat fostered the Dutch Golden Age. The Dutch also bene\\x00ted from the\\nmilitary developments that occurred in the war because, when coupled with theshipping capabilities of the Dutch East India Company, this strong shipping and\\nmilitary combination expanded Dutch power around the world.\\nTHE TOP\\nThe Dutch Golden Age led the Dutch to shift their attentions to “living\\nthe good life” in a way that weakened their \\x00nances. Other powers rose\\ntoo and began to challenge them. The arrival of capitalism, combined\\nwith the new approaches of the Enlightenment, led to an economic\\ntransformation called the Industrial Revolution, which was centered in\\nBritain. The Dutch, who had been the unparalleled leaders in innovation,\\ntrade, and wealth in the 1600s, failed to keep up. Eventually the cost of\\nmaintaining a declining and overextended empire became unsustainable.\\nThis chart shows a number of key steps.\\nAt the top, the Dutch saw a reversal of many of the classic ingredients we\\ndiscussed earlier:\\nThe Dutch educational and technological edge eroded.The Dutch became uncompetitive in general and via the decline of the\\nDutch East India Company.\\nIn the 1700s, the Industrial Revolution led the British to overtake\\nthe Dutch as the preeminent economic and \\x00nancial power in\\nEurope.\\nSlower economic growth relative to other powers made it more di\\x00cult to\\npay for and maintain its vast empire (especially one controlled by such a\\nsmall nation). Increasing military con\\x00icts (in attempts to protect their vast\\nwealth around the world) left the Dutch overextended and\\noverindebted.\\nThis all set the stage for the decline in the guilder’s reserve currency\\nstatus, which ultimately deteriorated after the Dutch lost a war (and with\\nit, important assets) to the British.\\nWith the Dutch Empire weakened, its \\x00nancial center eroded, especially\\nafter a series of debt crises and a run on the central bank and currency.\\nEven though the Peace of Westphalia brought relative peace and stability to\\nEurope, the Dutch were still engaged in a number of con\\x00icts throughout their\\ntime as an empire, as opponents saw their weaknesses and attacked, especially via\\nnaval wars fought over trade. Here is a brief summary of the wars the Dutch\\nfought to build and then to hold on to its empire:\\nEighty Years’ War (1566–1648): This was the revolt by Protestant\\nNetherlands against Catholic Spain. The Dutch \\x00rst declared\\nindependence in 1581, but their full independence was not realized until\\nthe Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended both the Thirty Years’ War and the\\nEighty Years’ War.\\nThe First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54): This was a trade war that\\nbegan when the English Parliament passed the Navigation Act of 1651,\\nmandating that all goods from its American colonies be carried by English\\nships. The war was largely a stalemate and failed to resolve the trade rivalry\\nbetween the nations.The Dano-Swedish War (1657–60): This began when Sweden declared\\nwar on Denmark, a Dutch ally, threatening the highly pro\\x00table Baltic\\ntrade routes. The Dutch defeated the Swedish.\\nThe Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–67): England and the\\nNetherlands fought over another trade dispute, which ended with a Dutch\\nvictory.\\nThe Franco-Dutch War (1672–78) and the Third Anglo-Dutch War\\n(1672–74): These were also \\x00ghts over trade. The Dutch foiled French\\nplans to conquer the Netherlands and forced them to reduce some of their\\ntari\\x00s, but at a tremendous cost.\\nThe Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780–84): The British began the war in\\nretaliation for Dutch support of the colonies in the American Revolution.\\nIt ended in a signi\\x00cant defeat for the Dutch, ushering in the end of the\\nguilder as a reserve currency.\\nIronically, it was a military victory, one that began nearly a century of peace,\\nthat led power to shift away from the Netherlands. In 1688, William III of\\nOrange married Mary II, who was the daughter of the unpopular king of\\nEngland, and successfully invaded England and took power. This was known as\\nthe Glorious Revolution and created a new internal order for Great Britain.\\nWhile it was undoubtedly good for the Dutch in the short run to have William\\nIII on the British throne, the second-order consequences of economic\\nintegration and military cooperation played a major role in the decline of\\nDutch economic power and the guilder over the next century.\\nAfter 1688, as Great Britain became more competitive, Dutch merchants\\nshifted their operations to London, hastening its rise as an international center\\nof \\x00nance. The alliance also gave English merchants access to Dutch trade.\\nWilliam III moved to England instead of focusing his attention on ruling the\\nNetherlands. When he died heirless in 1702, the direct connection between the\\ntwo nations was broken, and the various Dutch provinces that had been uni\\x00ed\\nunder him began to splinter. While England and the Netherlands continued to\\nhave military partnerships against the French during most of the 80-plus yearsleading up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, by the mid-1700s they were\\nbeginning to bump into each other in many of the same markets.\\nBy the mid-18th century, the Dutch Empire was no longer the world’s\\nleading empire. Britain especially had learned from Dutch innovations and made\\ntheir own investments in education to strengthen their people’s capabilities.\\nThese abilities, coupled with the use of capitalism, led to the advancements that\\nmade up the Industrial Revolution, which brought about constant\\nimprovements on existing concepts to make production more e\\x00cient, such as\\nstandardizing inputs and moving production from individual artisans to\\nfactories. It also led to transformative new inventions. This allowed the British to\\nbecome more productive, capture more trade, and build military might.\\nAdditionally, and as is classic, as the Dutch became extremely wealthy,\\nthey became less competitive—for example, their wages were generally higher\\nthan those in other parts of Europe. The Dutch East India Company lost its\\ncompetitive edge as well. For example, it was ine\\x00ective in trading popular new\\nproducts like tea. Dutch economic growth slowed relative to other powers,\\nwhich made it more di\\x00cult for the Dutch to pay for and maintain their\\nvast empire. Increasing military con\\x00icts to protect their vast wealth left them\\noverextended.\\nThus, from around 1725 through around 1800 the \\x00nancial decline\\nunfolded in the classic ways. These charts do a good job of conveying both the\\nascent and the decline of the Bank of Amsterdam.\\nAs is classic, the reserve currency status of the guilder remained strong even as\\nthe Netherlands’ other powers began to decline. Because bills of exchange were\\nthe dominant vehicle for international trade credit, all merchants wishing to\\ntrade with the Dutch were forced to open an account at the Bank of\\nAmsterdam, which led to around 40 percent of global trade being settled in\\nAmsterdam using bank guilders. The importance of the Dutch in trade and\\n\\x00nancial transactions, the Bank of Amsterdam’s policies that made the guilder\\nvery e\\x00ective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth, and the\\nfact that Dutch commercial entities and banks insisted on its usage all cemented\\nthe guilder’s place as the \\x00rst global reserve currency.7 This gave the Dutch the\\n“extraordinary privilege” of being able to get into a lot of debt.\\nTHE DECLINE\\nAround 1750 the British (and the French) became stronger than the\\nDutch, both because their own power had grown and because the Dutch\\nhad become weaker. As is classic, the Dutch a) became more indebted, b)\\nexperienced a lot of internal \\x00ghting over wealth,8 and c) weakened\\nmilitarily. All this made them vulnerable to decline and attack.\\nAs earnings from abroad fell, wealthy Dutch savers moved their cash into\\nBritish investments, which were more attractive due to their strong growth and\\nhigher yields.9 Despite this, the guilder remained widely used as a global reserve\\ncurrency. As explained earlier, reserve currency status classically lags the decline\\nof other key drivers of the rise and fall of empires. Then, as is typical, a rising\\ngreat power challenged the existing great power in a war.\\nStarting in the 1770s, the English began to interfere with Dutch shipping,\\nescalating the con\\x00ict after the Dutch traded arms with the colonies during the\\nAmerican Revolution. In retaliation, the English delivered a massive blow to the\\nDutch Navy in the Caribbean in 1781, taking over Dutch territories there and in\\nthe East Indies as well. Having lost half its ships and access to its key trade routes,\\nthe Dutch East India Company had to borrow heavily from the Bank ofAmsterdam to stay alive. Rival powers took the Dutch defeat as an opportunity\\nto grab still more of the Dutch shipping business. British blockades in the\\nNetherlands and in the East Indies caused a liquidity crisis. The \\x00nancial\\nconsequences of these events can be seen in the following charts.\\n10\\nFinancial losses and large debts led to the classic move by the central\\nbank to print more money. As the Bank of Amsterdam printed more and\\nmore paper money to provide loans to the Dutch East India Company, it\\nsoon became clear that there would not be enough gold and silver to\\ncover all the paper claims on it. That led to the classic “run on the bank”\\ndynamic, in which investors exchanged their paper money for precious\\nmetals. With the bank’s store of precious metals exhausted, the supply of\\nguilders soared, even as demand for them fell, as shown in the following chart.The next chart shows this explosion of loans on the bank’s balance sheet\\nthroughout the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. (For reference, the full balance sheet\\nat the start of the war was about 20 million bank guilders outstanding, so this\\nrepresented a roughly 50 percent expansion in the Bank of Amsterdam’s balance\\nsheet.) The Bank of Amsterdam had no choice; the Dutch East India Company\\nwas too big to fail because the government depended on loans from the\\ncompany.\\nInterest rates rose and the Bank of Amsterdam had to devalue,\\nundermining the credibility of the guilder as a storehold of wealth.11 As a\\nresult, the British pound replaced the Dutch guilder as the leading reserve\\ncurrency.\\nWhat happened to the Dutch was classic, as described in Chapter 1’s\\nsummary of why empires rise and fall and Chapter 3’s description of how\\nmoney, credit, and debt work. The Bank of Amsterdam started with a Type\\n1 monetary system (precious metal) that morphed into a Type 2\\nmonetary system (paper money linked to precious metal). As usual, thistransition occurred at a time of \\x00nancial stress and military con\\x00ict. It was risky\\nbecause the transition decreased trust in the currency and added to the risk of a\\nbank-run-like dynamic, which is exactly what occurred. Bank of Amsterdam\\ndeposits (i.e., holdings of short-term debt) had been a reliable storehold of\\nwealth for nearly two centuries. They began to trade at large discounts to guilder\\ncoins (which were made of gold and silver). The bank used its holdings of coin\\nand precious metals (i.e., its reserves) to buy its currency on the open market to\\nsupport the value of deposits, but it lacked adequate foreign currency reserves to\\ndo this inde\\x00nitely. Accounts backed by coins held at the bank plummeted from\\n17 million guilder in March 1780 to only 300,000 guilder in January 1783 as\\nowners of these gold and silver coins demanded them back. The bank run\\nmarked the end of the Dutch Empire and the guilder as a reserve currency. In\\n1791 the bank was taken over by the City of Amsterdam, and in 1795 the\\nFrench revolutionary government overthrew the Dutch Republic, establishing a\\nclient state in its place. After being nationalized in 1796, rendering its stock\\nworthless, the Dutch East India Company’s charter expired in 1799.\\nThe following charts show the exchange rates between the guilder and the\\npound and gold. As it became clear that the bank no longer had any credibility,\\ninvestors \\x00ed to other assets and currencies.12\\n13The next chart shows the returns of holding Dutch East India Company\\nstock starting in various years. As with most bubble companies, it did great at\\n\\x00rst and seemed to have great fundamentals. This attracted still more investors\\neven after those fundamentals began to weaken. Ultimately its failed\\nfundamentals and excessive debt burdens broke it.As is typical, the returns of investment assets in the declining empire fall\\nrelative to the returns of investing in the rising empire. Returns on investment in\\nthe British East India Company, for example, far exceeded those in the Dutch\\nEast India Company, and the returns on Dutch government bonds were terrible\\nrelative to British government bonds.\\nThe decline of the Dutch Empire led to the next Big Cycle in world history:\\nthe rise and decline of the British Empire and its reserve currency. That story—which is basically the same story, just a century or so later in a more\\ntechnologically evolved form with people in di\\x00erent clothes speaking a di\\x00erent\\nlanguage—is told in the next chapter.\\n1 By 1500, the territory of modern-day Spain was increasingly uni\\x00ed following more than 500 years of\\ncon\\x00ict between Christian kingdoms and Muslim powers that had ruled most of the area since the 700s.\\nThe two largest kingdoms, Castile and Aragon, were joined together following the marriage of their rulers\\nin 1469, and in 1492 they conquered Spain’s last Muslim kingdom in Granada. The emergent Spanish\\npower had a strong military and very close ties to the Catholic Church—signi\\x00cant portions of the\\nReconquista of Muslim Spain took the form of papally supported crusades, and religious and monarchic\\nauthorities were often closely aligned, as in the Spanish Inquisition.\\n2 For example, the Wars of Religion in France led to millions of deaths from 1550 to 1600, while England\\nviolently switched faiths at several points in the 1500s as new monarchs came to the throne. Even later on,\\nthe devastating English Civil Wars of the mid-1600s were signi\\x00cantly driven by religious strife.\\n3 Rough estimate based on my calculations.\\n4 In this chapter, when talking about the “guilder,” we are generally referring to guilder bank notes, which\\nwere used at the Bank of Amsterdam, rather than to the physical coin (also called “guilder”), which was\\nmade of a precious metal (i.e., Type 1 money).\\n5 By 1650, it was fairly common for, say, a merchant in London to pay for goods imported from Moscow\\nwith a bill drawn on their deposit in Amsterdam. Both the number of accounts and deposit base of the\\nbank rose continually through 1650.\\n6 Cardinal Richelieu was the most important leader in France at the time, serving as chief minister from\\n1624 until 1642. Richelieu was a brilliant man who provided advice to the two rivals for control of the\\nmonarchy in France: the queen mother and her young son Louis XIII. (You can’t make this stu\\x00 up.)\\nRichelieu had his own particular view of how an internal order should work, which was that the state\\nshould be all-powerful—more important than what the monarchy, church, or nobility wanted. Besides\\nbeing a great big-picture thinker, he was a great administrator who made the system work well. He\\nimproved e\\x00ciency throughout the kingdom, e\\x00ectively collecting taxes and controlling power over the\\nnobility and local authorities. He created the notions of national interest and balance of power—e.g.,\\nfocusing policy on the goal of having France balance the Habsburg hegemony. This wasn’t that long after\\nMachiavelli’s theories \\x00rst circulated. His concept of keeping Central Europe divided and balanced\\n(because united it would dominate other areas) worked from 1624 until the French Revolution (for more,\\nsee Henry Kissinger’s World Order).\\n7 Available payment data supports the claim that the guilder accounted for a large share of global trade: the\\nannual value of payments made through the bank peaked in the 1760s at about 1.5 times the Dutch\\nRepublic’s annual GDP (with some estimates more than double that). Similar ratios for the United\\nKingdom in 1868 and the United States in 1955 were 3.6 and 2.7, respectively.\\n8 A good example of this is the popularity of the Patriot Movement in the Netherlands around this time.9 There was a general rise in foreign investment by the Dutch during this period. Examples include Dutch\\npurchases of stock in the British East India Company and the City of London selling term annuities\\n(bonds) to Dutch investors. For a further description, see Hart, Jonker, and van Zanden, A Financial\\nHistory of the Netherlands.\\n10 This chart only shows the \\x00nancial results from the Dutch East India Company reported in patria, i.e.,\\nthe Netherlands. It does not include the parts of the revenue and debt from its operations in Asia but does\\ninclude its revenue from goods it sourced in Asia and sold in Europe.\\n11 The Bank of Amsterdam was ahead of its time and used ledgers instead of real “paper money.” See Quinn\\n& Roberds, “The Bank of Amsterdam Through the Lens of Monetary Competition.”\\n12 Historical data suggests that by 1795 bank deposits were trading at a -25 percent discount to actual coin.\\nSee Quinn & Roberds, “Death of a Reserve Currency.”\\n13 To fully represent the likely economics of a deposit holder at the Bank of Amsterdam, we assumed\\ndepositors each received their pro-rated share of precious metal still in the bank’s vaults when it closed (that\\nwas roughly 20 percent of the fully backed amount, thus the approximately 80 percent total devaluation).CHAPTER 10\\nTHE BIG CYCLE RISE AND DECLINE OF\\nTHE BRITISH EMPIRE AND THE POUND\\nChanges in the world order come about when two or more countries (or\\nalliances of countries) of comparable power \\x00ght and one wins and\\nbecomes dominant enough to set the new rules, which is the new world\\norder. Before this happens, the rising country needs to get itself into a\\ncomparable position of strength relative to the reigning country, so the\\nstory of any great country’s rise begins long before it becomes a great\\npower. Likewise, the story of its decline extends long after it ceases to be a great\\npower. That is re\\x00ected in the arc chart that shows the simpli\\x00ed version of the\\ncycles of the Dutch, British, American, and Chinese empires that I shared with\\nyou before and share here again.\\nThe rise of the British Empire started long before it became preeminent, as it\\n\\x00rst had to build its educational, institutional, and technological strengths to\\nbecome more competitive and then challenge and defeat the Dutch. This chart\\nshows my gauges of the eight measures of power for the British Empire from1600 to the present. As shown, competitiveness, education, and innovation and\\ntechnology levels rose sharply in the early 1600s and continued to increase\\nsteadily from 1600 to 1800, which paid o\\x00 from 1700 to 1900 as the UK’s\\noutput, share of world trade, and military expanded together. With the typical\\nlag, the development of Britain’s \\x00nancial markets and its \\x00nancial center\\n(London) to become world leaders followed, and, with a greater lag, the pound\\novertook the guilder as the global reserve currency.\\nWhile the fall of the Dutch in the late 1700s removed the UK’s\\nprimary trade and \\x00nancial competitor, Britain's rise wasn’t complete\\nuntil the early 1800s because it had one last great rival power to defeat—\\nFrance, led by Napoleon. You see, Napoleon was on a tear to conquer Europe\\nand be the greatest power via the Napoleonic Wars. This created the usual sort of\\ngreat power rivalry and balance of power struggle dynamic that I described in the\\naddendum to Chapter 2, with all the alliances and escalation building to a great\\ncrescendo. Later in this chapter, I will brie\\x00y drop into the French story, also an\\niconic one, as part of explaining the rise of the British Empire. But for now I will\\nsimply jump to the punchline, which is that Britain won through e\\x00ective\\neconomic as well as military warfare. Then, following the classic BigCycle script of what happens after wars that establish the dominant\\npower, there was a new world order set out by the winners followed by a\\nlong period—in this case 100 years—of relative peace and prosperity.\\nThat is when the British Empire became the greatest empire ever. At its\\npeak, with only 2.5 percent of the world’s population in the UK, the British\\nempire produced over 20 percent of the world’s income and controlled over 20\\npercent of the world’s land mass and over 25 percent of the global population.\\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. As shown in the previous chart, the story of\\nBritain’s rise began around 1600, so we should start there. The following chart\\nshows the arc and the timing of key events. The numbers mark the approximate\\ntimes of the six stages of the internal order cycle.\\nTHE RISE\\nTo set the stage for the UK’s rise, we need to describe its situation, as well as the\\nbroader backdrop of Europe, at the end of the 1600s. For both, the early 17th\\ncentury had massive con\\x00icts that radically changed or overturned all the prior\\norders. As explained in the last chapter, in Europe there was great\\ndevastation and change that resulted from the Thirty Years’ War because\\nit was a war between ideologies, religions, and economic classes that\\ncreated a new European order through the Peace of Westphalia. Thistreaty established countries as we know them and created a fractured\\nEurope, which led to di\\x00erent choices in di\\x00erent countries. Great Britain\\nhad its own turmoil over wealth and power that took the forms of the English\\nCivil War, which was a brutally violent continuation of the centuries-long\\nbattles between classes, and the Glorious Revolution, which less violently led to\\nWilliam III, a Dutch ruler, becoming the king of England. What these con\\x00icts\\nhave in common is that they weakened the monarchy and strengthened\\nParliament. They also established terms for the relationships between the\\nkingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The English Civil War\\nspeci\\x00cally led to the king (Charles I) being tried and executed and the\\nmonarchy being replaced by the Commonwealth of England under the\\nrule of the general who led the revolt, Oliver Cromwell.\\nThese con\\x00icts established rule of law rather than rule of the\\nmonarchy and they created a new balance of power between the king and\\nParliament that set the foundation for Great Britain’s later rise. That is because\\na strong Parliament allowed for a moderately meritocratic selection of national\\nleaders, as the prime minister had to command the con\\x00dence of Parliament\\nrather than just be a favorite of the royal court. Statesmen who led Britain during\\nits later rise and peak—such as William Pitt the Elder and his son, Will Pitt the\\nYounger, Robert Peel, William Gladstone, and Benjamin Disraeli—were strong\\nforces for shaping Britain. They all came from families of merchants, not the\\nlanded gentry.\\nThis revolutionary strengthening of Parliament was heavily in\\x00uenced by the\\nnew Enlightenment thinking about who should have what powers and how\\ngovernments should work that had spread throughout Europe starting in the\\nlate 1600s. That was shaped by the earlier scienti\\x00c thought of Englishman\\nFrancis Bacon (1561–1626). At the core of this new, human-centric\\nphilosophy was the idea that society should be based on reason and\\nscience and that the government’s power comes from the people, not\\nfrom God.\\nDebate and skepticism were encouraged. Improvements in basic\\neducation (which caused literacy rates to rise), the dissemination of ideas\\nvia printed materials (the \\x00rst encyclopedias and dictionaries wereprinted en masse at this time), and a growing number of transnational\\nelites (who were well-read and cultivated cross-border contacts) created a\\nnew and wider “public sphere” of political and social thought. The key\\nthinkers during this time produced ideas and concepts that are still\\nimportant in the Western world.\\nEnlightenment ideas in\\x00uenced di\\x00erent countries in di\\x00erent ways, ranging\\nfrom more autocratic monarchs like Catherine the Great in Russia to the more\\nrepresentative form of government adopted by America’s Founding Fathers.\\nThe UK particularly reaped the bene\\x00ts of the Enlightenment’s strong\\npolitical institutions and rule of law alongside the Enlightenment’s\\nemphasis on science, which supported major discoveries.\\nWhile these strengths did not bring about immediate prosperity, over time\\nthe British system’s respect for the rule of law, combined with strong\\neducation, gave it the foundation to gain competitive advantages in\\ncommerce and innovations that followed and led to the rise of the British\\nEmpire.\\nAt the same time, England became \\x00nancially strong as it created a\\npowerful and centralized \\x00scal authority that allowed the state to raise\\nsigni\\x00cantly more revenue than its international rivals. By the 18th\\ncentury, the tax burden in Britain was almost twice that of France. The\\ncreation of the Bank of England in 1694 helped standardize and increase\\nthe liquidity of UK government debt, improving its ability to borrow.\\nConsistent with these reforms, government bond yields fell drastically, both\\noutright and relative to other countries over the early 1700s.\\nBy the early 1700s, there were many other classic signs of an empire on the\\nrise. In these charts, you can see Britain’s leadership in innovation compared to\\nits main rivals at the time.\\nThe Industrial Re volution\\nA well-educated population together with a culture of inventiveness and\\nthe availability of capital to \\x00nancially support the developments of new\\nideas—especially about how machines could more e\\x00ciently do what\\nmany were laboring to do—created a great wave of competitiveness and\\nprosperity. England’s geological endowments of iron and coal gave it a\\ngreat boost in producing this economic transformation known as the\\nFirst Industrial Revolution. As described in Chapter 8, this shift\\nchanged Europe from a primarily rural and agrarian society in which\\nmost people were poor and power resided with landowning elites to an\\nurban and industrial society in which people as a whole got a lot richer\\n(though bene\\x00ts disproportionately accrued to the elites) and powerresided with central government bureaucrats and capitalists.\\nGeopolitically, these strengths led it to overtake the Dutch as the\\npreeminent economic and \\x00nancial power in Europe around 1750, 30\\nyears before the UK defeated the Dutch in the battle and clearly became\\nthe world's leading empire.\\nThe productivity revolution started with agriculture. Agricultural inventions\\nincreased productivity, which reduced the labor intensity of farming. It also\\nmade food more plentiful and cheaper, which led to a population boom.\\nTogether these forces led to people \\x00ocking to cities, which bene\\x00ted industry\\nfrom the steadily increasing supply of labor. The Industrial Revolution was\\ndriven not only by the creation of brand-new inventions like the steam engine\\nbut also by adapting and improving on existing concepts to make production\\nmore e\\x00cient, such as standardizing inputs and moving production from\\nindividual artisans to factories. Ample labor, energy, and connected global\\nmarkets together helped support the burst of innovation. This list gives a sense\\nof the timing and pace of innovation in the UK:\\n1712: Steam engine invented.\\n1719: Silk factory established.\\n1733: Flying shuttle (basic weaving machine) invented.\\n1764: Spinning jenny (multi-spindle weaving machine) invented.\\n1765: Separate condenser (for steam engines) invented.\\n1769: Water frame (hydraulic power for weaving machines) invented; steam\\nengine upgraded.\\n1785: Power loom invented; iron re\\x00ning developed.\\n1801: Steam-powered locomotive on wheels invented.\\n1816: Steam-powered locomotive on rail patented.\\n1825: Railway construction initiated on a line connecting Manchester and\\nLiverpool.\\nThrough these revolutionary changes to agriculture and industry Europe\\nbecame urban and industrial, with goods made by machines in city factories.The new urban population required new types of goods and services, which\\nrequired the government to get bigger and spend money on things like housing,\\nsanitation, and education, as well as to set up the infrastructure for the new\\nindustrial capitalist system to \\x00ourish, such as courts, regulators, and central\\nbanks. Power was in the hands of central government bureaucrats and\\ncapitalists who controlled the means of production.\\nThis was most true in the United Kingdom, which pioneered many of\\nthe most important innovations and which used the new methods of\\nproduction to pull ahead of other nations and become the world’s\\nleading superpower. As re\\x00ected in output per capita, the UK’s living\\nstandards caught up to those in the Netherlands by around 1800 and overtook\\nthem in the mid-19th century, when the UK approached the zenith of its share\\nof world output (around 20 percent). In parallel to this economic growth—and\\nhelping to reinforce it—the UK became the world’s dominant trading nation,\\npulling decisively ahead of the Dutch in the late 1700s and maintaining that\\nposition through the 19th century. At the same time there was an acceleration in\\nthe output of all countries through most of the 1800s. Most countries in the\\nworld were then in Stages 3 and 4 of the internal order cycle.\\nNaturally as it became a world economic power the UK needed to be able to\\n\\x00ght militarily to both protect and assert its interests. The UK's military\\nstrength—especially its navy—helped it establish its colonies and take\\nover those of other European powers, as well as secure its control over\\nglobal trade routes. The pro\\x00tability of the empire more than paid for its\\nmilitary spending because it supported economic activities. Thanks to theBank of England’s \\x00nancial innovations and the guilder’s collapse, London\\nbecame the world’s \\x00nancial center and the pound sterling the world’s\\nreserve currency. In other words, Great Britain followed the classic Big\\nCycle steps of a rising empire.\\nBritain also took the Netherlands’ mantle as the top trader with China. With\\nthe Industrial Revolution, Europe no longer demanded nearly as much in the\\nway of manufactured luxury goods from China, but instead sought a\\ncommodity—tea. China, for its part, wasn’t interested in European goods and\\ncontinued to seek payment in precious metals. That sowed the seeds of the great\\nBritish-Chinese con\\x00ict that led to the Opium Wars and China’s Century of\\nHumiliation. Who would have imagined that?\\nThe story of Britain’s rise is obvious in retrospect. It’s easy to look back and\\ndescribe what happened. It’s another thing to position oneself well for it by\\nanticipating it and seeing it happen at the time. I wonder what I would have\\nthought at the time. I wonder whether in looking at the readings of my\\nindicators and systems and thinking about the situations whether I would have\\nbet well. That is why it is so important to me to have the data and the decision\\nrules to see what I would have actually done and what the results would have\\nbeen. I can now see what the indicators would have shown at the time and know\\nthat they would have painted the picture I just described, and I can see from that\\nthat the picture would not have been crystal clear that the British Empire would\\nhave gone on to become the dominant world empire. If I were alive in the early\\n1700s and looking at my indicators, I would have seen the Dutch still at their\\npeak and Bourbon France as a major power on the rise also, and I would have\\nseen bullish conditions for them both at that time.\\nWhy Not the F rench?\\nIn the early 1700s, France was a center of education and learning, a hub of the\\nEnlightenment with famous thinkers like Voltaire and Montesquieu, and a\\nhome to a booming publishing industry, so my indicators would have shown the\\nFrench as being just as strong as the Dutch and British powers. From 1720 to\\n1780, the number of books on the arts and science published in Paris doubled.As the quantity of information increased, so did people’s literacy; over the\\ncourse of the 18th century literacy rates in France close to doubled.\\nFrance also would have shown up as economically strong in the early stage of\\na big debt cycle upswing. It was just before an investment boom was about to\\nturn into a bubble which later turned into a bust. At the time, France’s most\\nfamous economist was John Law (a Scotsman by birth) who thought the\\ncreation of new money would stimulate the economy. In 1716 he created a\\nnational bank with the ability to issue paper money backed by land, gold, silver,\\nand state bills. That began the upswing in the cycle. The original capital for this\\nbank, Banque Générale, was provided by shareholders, who also sat on the\\nbank’s board. France had had a stock market since 1673, when Finance Minister\\nJean-Baptiste Colbert’s Ordinance of Trade was codi\\x00ed into commercial law,1\\nso it had all the ingredients for a classic capital markets upswing. At the same\\ntime, Law also created the Company of the West. The Company of the West, or\\nthe Mississippi Company, was a trading company with monopoly rights in\\nFrench Louisiana (half of the present-day United States). Law allowed French\\ngovernment debt to be used to purchase shares in the Mississippi Company.\\nWith a new company that had an exciting story about exploiting the\\nopportunities of the new frontier and a bank and government \\x00nances\\nsupporting this endeavor, all the right ingredients were in place. As the company\\nexpanded, state debt holders jumped at the ability to convert their debt into\\nequity. This created what was perceived to be a great investment. Would you\\nhave bought in? Would I have bought in? If we didn’t would we have had\\nregrets? The stock soared, eventually becoming a bubble in the classic ways thesethings happen. When it burst, both shares and bills rapidly lost their value\\nbecause of the classic reason of the outstanding claims on real assets being much\\ngreater than the real assets that were backing up the claims.\\nNaturally people in France \\x00ed from the depreciating paper money\\ntoward hard currency coinage. New laws prohibited charging interest rates\\nabove 5 percent, which meant that only the most credit-worthy borrowers and\\nmost stable investments could receive capital. As a result, it became nearly\\nimpossible for new businesses to receive funding. There wasn’t enough real\\nmoney.\\nOn top of that, and quite typically, expensive wars made \\x00nancial conditions\\nworse. A partial list of wars that France was in follows:\\nWar of the League of Augsburg (1688–97): France, under the\\nleadership of Louis XIV, expanded into modern-day western Germany,\\nspurring war against England, Spain, Austria, and a number of German\\nstates.\\nWar of the Spanish Succession (1701–14): France, allied with Spain,\\nfought an alliance of England, Austria, and the Netherlands to contest the\\ninheritance of the Spanish throne. The war ended with the French heir\\ntaking the throne of Spain, but with various concessions made to the other\\npowers (including giving up Spanish territory in Italy and Belgium to\\nAustria, and France giving England and the Netherlands colonial and trade\\nconcessions).\\nWar of the Austrian Succession (1740–48): France, in alliance with\\nSpain, Prussia, and other German principalities, fought against Austria and\\nthe UK, in support of the German princes’ territorial ambitions against\\nAustria.\\nSeven Years’ War (1756–63): France, allied with Austria, Sweden, and\\nRussia, fought against Britain and Prussia over German territories and\\nFrench and British colonies abroad, particularly in North America. (This\\nwar is also known as the French and Indian War.)\\nAmerican Revolution (1775–83): France and Spain allied with the\\nAmerican revolutionary forces against the British government.While a number of these wars produced territorial and strategic gains for\\nFrance, they turned out to cost much more than they brought in which\\neventually severely damaged the French government’s \\x00nances. Without a\\nmodern \\x00nancial system, France had more di\\x00culty funding its government\\nthrough debt than Britain did so it had to rely more on burdensome taxes,\\nwhich were unpopular. One example of France’s inferior \\x00nancial position\\na\\x00ecting its geopolitical position is the di\\x00erences in experiences of the British\\nand the French during the American Revolution. The French paid for the war\\ne\\x00ort entirely by \\x00oating loans at interest rates at least double those the British\\ngovernment faced. This caused France’s debt service payments to rise to over £14\\nmillion compared to Britain’s £7 million (both had national debts of around\\n£220 million). Because the nobility, clergy, and even certain privileged towns\\noften paid lower taxes, high levels of taxation on the rest of society were\\nimposed. That exacerbated France’s already high income inequality. Many\\nFrench laborers struggled to meet their basic needs. That caused more class\\nwarfare.\\nAlong with extreme income inequality, there was corruption and\\nextravagance at the top. The court of King Louis XVI was infamous for its\\nfrivolous spending—for instance, Marie Antoinette’s Hamlet, an ornamental\\nfarm near the gardens of Versailles built at great expense to replicate a rustic\\nvillage. Two major wars—the Seven Years’ War and the American\\nRevolution—led to massive de\\x00cits. During the American Revolution the\\nde\\x00cits were around 2–3 percent of GDP and about a third of France’s annual\\ntax revenue. Meanwhile, the American Revolution further popularized\\nEnlightenment ideas of liberty and equality, while bad harvests in 1788 and\\n1789 led to soaring bread prices and famines. It was a recipe for revolution.\\nDue to France’s ine\\x00cient and unrepresentative political decision-\\nmaking system, the government was unable to raise needed revenues or\\nenact needed changes. Decisions from the ancien régime could be and often\\nwere undermined at virtually every lower level. The nobility and clergy resisted\\ndecisions that hurt them and were able to carve out broad privileges for\\nthemselves. Local authorities (called p a r l e m e n t s) were needed to enact tax policy,\\nbut often resisted doing so. The closest thing France had to a legislative body wasthe Estates General, where representatives of France’s three estates (the clergy,\\nthe nobility, and the commoners) met to approve certain legislation when\\nsummoned by the king. Its consent was seen as necessary to levy new national\\ntaxes; however, its powers and procedures were unclear, and basic questions—\\nlike how representatives were chosen and how many votes each estate got—w ere\\nunsettled. In 1789, the Third Estate—representing the commoners, who made\\nup 98 percent of the population—formed its own assembly, inviting members of\\nthe First and Second Estates to join it. To stop this National Assembly from\\nmeeting, the king closed their meeting hall.\\nProtests, riots, and insurrection arose. In 1791, a newly elected National\\nConvention declared France a republic, and in January 1793 Louis XVI (by\\nthen o\\x00cially called “Citizen Louis”) was sentenced to death. As is classic in\\nrevolutions, violence began soon after, in which those who were deemed\\ninsu\\x00ciently zealous were purged. It is estimated that between 20,000 and\\n30,000 people were executed during the French Reign of Terror. By 1795,\\nFrance was broke, and the assignat—the currency it printed to \\x00nance\\ngovernment spending—was experiencing hyperin\\x00ation.\\nAs is also classic, the revolution led to a counterreaction in which the\\nrevolution’s leaders were themselves arrested and a new constitution written and\\napproved. The new system (the Directorate) proved to be ine\\x00ective and was\\nimmediately crippled by \\x00nancial problems. Still, the government continued\\nto print money and forced wealthy citizens to loan it funds. Ultimately,\\nthe in\\x00ationary spiral was halted by the introduction of the hard currency that\\nwas acquired through Napoleon’s successful military conquests in Italy and thedecision to declare bankruptcy on two-thirds of the government’s debt.\\nAdditional measures such as increased taxes further strengthened the\\ngovernment’s \\x00scal condition. In 1796, the government held a ceremony in\\nwhich it destroyed the presses it had been using to print money.\\nEnter Napoleon\\nThe bubble, the big wealth gaps, and the costly expense of war led to the bust\\nand then to revolution, which threw out the old order and put in a new one.\\nThat new order consisted of revolutionary leaders who fought with each other,\\nproducing 10 years of painful chaos that required a strong leader to get control\\nof the mess. It was all consistent with the classic, melodramatic script that has\\nplayed innumerable times in the past. As if on cue, Napoleon entered the\\npicture. Napoleon was the classic hero rising to the occasion. He had\\ngained a sterling reputation as a military commander as France attempted to\\nspread its republican system across Europe, and he was very popular. So, in\\n1799, he led a coup to install himself as \\x00rst consul and eventually emperor, and\\nheld dictatorial powers until 1814. Armed with centralized power and\\nwidespread support, he stabilized the economy and professionalized the\\ngovernment; France was widely seen as an empire on the rise and a formidable\\nrival to other European powers.\\nWhen Austria and Russia declared war on France, Napoleon scored sizable\\nearly military victories. Before long, he controlled Spain, Portugal, Italy, and\\nmuch of Germany. I won’t go through the history of the Napoleonic Wars,\\nexcept to say that like other such leaders he overreached. Napoleon’s invasion ofRussia swung the tide of war against him. In the end, France was defeated.\\nGreat Britain and Russia were the primary victors.\\nIt should be noted that a signi\\x00cant factor in the war was the UK’s much\\ngreater \\x00nancial strength. Because of their \\x00nancial strength, the UK was able\\nto lend a lot of money to the European coalition forces against France. It\\nwas both its \\x00nancial resources and its naval power that allowed Britain to stay in\\nthe \\x00ght even as it and its allies su\\x00ered repeated defeats.\\nA New W orld Or der: The Congr ess of Vienna\\nBy now you know how these things go. After a war the victors come together\\nand create a new world order. That happened at the Congress of Vienna. Just as\\nthe victors of the Thirty Years’ War had done at Westphalia, the quadruple\\nalliance of Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia reorganized the\\nworld order in their favor at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), creating\\na system of checks and balances among the European powers that would\\nmore or less hold for the next century. The geopolitical importance of these\\ndevelopments is well-described by Henry Kissinger:\\nIt may not have ful\\x00lled all the hopes of an idealistic generation, but it\\ngave this generation something perhaps more precious: a period of\\nstability which permitted their hopes to be realized without a major war\\nor a permanent revolution… The period of stability which ensued was the\\nbest proof that a “legitimate” order had been constructed, an order\\naccepted by all the major powers, so that henceforth they sought\\nadjustment within its framework rather than in its overthrow.\\nAll the major powers were represented in Vienna, though the most important\\ndecisions were negotiated by the core group and France itself. Like the US at the\\nParis Peace Conference after World War I and in the negotiations after World\\nWar II, the UK didn’t seek to gain signi\\x00cant new territories. Its primary goal\\nwas to address the power imbalances in Europe that had led to wars.\\nAreas that had previously consisted of weak and divided states, such as\\nItaly, Germany, and the Low Countries, saw signi\\x00cant territorialconsolidation to counterbalance more centralized states like France, while\\nagreements on the navigation of international rivers supported the expansion of\\ntrade. Tactically, the Treaties of Paris aimed to contain but not destroy France,\\nwhich su\\x00ered only a minimal loss of territory.2\\nThe victorious powers were all monarchies, and many of the policies\\nthey enacted were aimed at restoring the old status quo (for example,\\nreturning the Bourbon dynasty to power in France). Even so, the new ideas of\\nthe Enlightenment continued to have in\\x00uence. Governments shifted to\\nmore representative and rule-of-law-based systems, though to varying\\ndegrees (Tsarist Russia remained largely autocratic). In England the\\nliberalization came about as a result of gradual reforms, while on the continent a\\nseries of revolutions (most famously the liberal Revolutions of 1848) spurred the\\nchanges. In time, nationalist movements led to the uni\\x00cation of Germany\\nand Italy, as well as the destabilization of the multiethnic Austrian and\\nOttoman empires.\\nBritish P ower A pproaches Its P eak\\nNo power bene\\x00ted more from the new stability than the British Empire. Not\\nonly were Britain’s main economic and military rivals weakened, but the\\npower equilibrium allowed the UK to avoid expensive military con\\x00icts\\nclose to home and focus on trade and its colonies, a policy known as\\n“splendid isolation,” which set the stage for its “Imperial Century.” Of\\ncourse there were some bad economic periods during those years (e.g., the Panic\\nof 1825 in the UK, and the panics of 1837 and 1873 in the US), and there were\\nmilitary con\\x00icts (e.g., the Crimean War between Russia on one side and the\\nOttoman Empire and a coalition of Western European powers on the other).\\nBut these were not signi\\x00cant enough to change the big picture, which was of a\\nvery prosperous period with the British on top. As mentioned, at their peak in\\nthe late 19th century around 1870, the British produced 20 percent of the\\nworld’s income and controlled 40 percent of global exports, 20 percent of the\\nworld’s land mass, and 25 percent of the world’s population. And the pound, ofcourse, became the world’s undisputed reserve currency. The charts on the\\nfollowing pages help paint the picture of Britain’s dominant strength.\\nGeopolitically, the UK continued to expand abroad throughout the 19th\\ncentury, eventually encompassing Canada, Australia, India, and large portions of\\nAfrica.3 And even where the British Empire didn’t explicitly take control, it was\\nincreasingly able to intervene abroad in order to gain trade access on uneven\\nterms (e.g., the Opium Wars against China ending with a treaty ensuring the\\nUK’s ability to export opium to China despite local Chinese laws against it).\\nMaintaining these colonies gave the UK an assured source of commodities,\\nwealth, and income, and preferential trade arrangements. This chart clearly\\npaints the picture.\\nTHE TOP\\nThe pound’s status as a reserve currency complemented its dominance in\\ncolonial expansion, military reach, global trade, and investment \\x00ows. The UK’s\\nshare of global exports rose with the Industrial Revolution and the\\nspread of the empire, peaking around 1850 at about 40 percent of global\\nexports. And the share of trade denominated in sterling was greater than the\\nUK’s trade share alone. From 1850 to 1914, around 60 percent of global trade\\nwas denominated in pounds. This set of conditions sowed the seeds of the\\ndecline that typify the top phase of the Big Cycle.Even as the UK’s share of world exports declined, the UK ran a persistent\\ncurrent account surplus throughout this period. After 1870, this was comprised\\nof a persistent trade de\\x00cit funded by returns on overseas investments. The\\nincome from the current account surpluses funded an increasing share of global\\ncross-border investment as other countries become more attractive to invest in.\\nIn 1818, the English Rothschild bank made its \\x00rst major government loan,\\nto Prussia. As the pound became increasingly liquid, a wave of other sovereign\\nborrowers followed, and global debt, global trade, and global capital \\x00ows all\\ncame to be increasingly denominated in sterling.4 Trust in the pound was\\nbolstered by the economic management of the Bank of England, which\\nincreasingly operated as a “lender of last resort” to mitigate the e\\x00ects of banking\\npanics.5Even as the British Empire continued to expand its territorial and\\n\\x00nancial reach over the \\x00nal decades of the 19th century, the seeds of its\\nfall were evident, driven by the classic factors of 1) declining\\ncompetitiveness, 2) rising inequality and con\\x00ict, and 3) the rise of new\\nrivals, particularly Germany and the US.\\nDeclining Competitiv eness\\nStepping back, the broader story of economic growth in the mid-to-late\\n1800s was the Second Industrial Revolution, a sustained period of\\ninnovation in which science as well as engineering played a major role, as\\nsynthetics and new alloys were produced and the use of new energy sources like\\npetroleum and electricity exploded. This was when the telephone and the\\nincandescent light bulb were developed and automobiles soon followed.\\nTransportation, communications, and infrastructure improved, and the\\nrise of corporate capitalism enhanced productivity. The result was a sizable\\nincrease in output per worker in the countries able to make the switch\\ne\\x00ciently—primarily the US and Germany. The UK didn’t keep up, even\\nthough British inventions were key to many of these new developments. The\\nUK’s failure to reorganize its industries led to marked declines in output per\\nworker relative to the other leading industrial powers. You can see the secular\\nshift in innovation and economic power in these charts.6\\nRising Inequality\\nThe gains from industrialization were distributed very unevenly in the UK,\\nproducing extreme levels of inequality. By the late 1800s, the top 1 percent of\\nthe population owned over 70 percent of all wealth, more than in peer countries.\\nThe UK’s top 10 percent owned an astounding 93 percent of its wealth.7 As\\nshown in the next chart, the peak in the wealth gap coincided with the peak in\\nthe British Empire around 1900, which was the beginning of the next wave of\\ncon\\x00ict over wealth and power due to large wealth gaps and the classic late Big\\nCycle conditions described in Part I.\\nThe combination of social change and rising inequality sparked signi\\x00cant\\ntensions. England’s policy response in the mid-1800s focused largely on reform\\nbills that expanded voting rights and reduced the corrupt practices that had\\nmade elections less democratic. By the early 1900s, those political reforms were\\nfollowed by social reforms, which included the introduction of a public pension\\nsystem, medical and unemployment insurance, and the provision of free lunchesfor school children. Organized labor was also on the rise, strengthening workers’\\nbargaining power. By 1911, around 25 percent of eligible men were union\\nmembers, and the Labour Party became a signi\\x00cant force in politics. This\\ngreater power took the form of increasingly large strikes—for example, the \\x00rst\\nnational strike by coal miners in 1912, which led to a minimum wage for miners.\\nGeopolitical Riv als Emer ge\\nIn addition to its domestic issues, the UK faced challengers to its empire\\nabroad, competing for in\\x00uence with France in Africa, Russia in the Middle\\nEast and Central Asia, and the US in the Americas. Its most signi\\x00cant\\nrivalry, however, was with Germany. The United States, the other great rising\\npower, remained blissfully isolationist with a big ocean allowing it to largely\\nignore the con\\x00icts in Europe.\\nWhen the new world order began at the Congress of Vienna, Germany\\nwas still divided into a number of smaller states. While the Austrian\\nEmpire, ruled by the Habsburgs, had a lot of in\\x00uence, Prussia was swiftly rising\\nand had one of the strongest armies in Europe. Over the next century, it\\nsuccessfully uni\\x00ed the other German states, becoming a \\x00rst-rate power.\\nIt achieved this thanks in large part to Otto von Bismarck’s brilliant\\nstrategic and diplomatic leadership8 and the other classic ingredients for\\nsuccess: strong education and competitiveness.\\nOnce uni\\x00ed, Germany experienced the classic virtuous cycle of a\\npower on the rise. Viewing an e\\x00ective education system as a crucial step\\nin its quest to raise its economy to the level of Great Britain’s, the new\\nGermany—and its predecessor states—built one from the ground up,\\nfocusing on teaching both practical trade skills and high-level scienti\\x00c\\nknowledge, theoretical and applied. Starting in the 1860s, primary education\\nwas mandatory for all and enforced by law. Germany also established three new\\nresearch universities.In order to create a culture of innovation, the German government\\nprovided credit to corporations, along with technical advice and\\nassistance; awarded grants to inventors and immigrant entrepreneurs;\\nbestowed gifts of machinery; and allowed rebates and exemptions of\\nduties on imports of industrial equipment. Germany also maintained a\\nstrong rule of law, which was explicitly aimed at economic development.\\nAs a result of these e\\x00orts, Germany’s share of the world’s manufacturing\\noutput increased from about 5 to 13 percent between 1860 and 1900 while the\\nother European powers’ shares stagnated or decreased. By 1900, Germany’s\\nGDP had surpassed Britain’s (excluding its empire), although the latter\\nwas still the leading trading nation in the world.While Bismarck was a skilled diplomat who prioritized economic\\ndevelopment and diplomacy with international competitors, his successors were\\nless skilled and more aggressive. When Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888,\\nhe forced Bismarck to resign and adopted a policy of turning Germany\\ninto a world power. This led other powers, primarily Russia and the UK, to\\nincreasingly align with France (a bitter rival of Germany since the Franco-\\nPrussian War in 1871) in an e\\x00ort to contain Germany. Wilhelm moved to\\nbuild up Germany’s military, particularly its navy, setting o\\x00 an arms\\nrace with the UK. This began the next rivalry between great powers.\\nThe UK retained its naval advantage, but the arms race strained the \\x00nances\\nof the major powers and further destabilized the geopolitical order. The rivalry\\nbetween the UK and Germany was just one of many building across\\nEurope—France and Germany were at odds, Germany was increasingly\\nconcerned about Russian industrialization, and Austria and Russia were\\nstruggling for in\\x00uence in the Balkans. Though these countries wereintertwined through marriage and commerce more than ever before, and\\ndespite most people believing it wouldn’t happen, in 1914 the powder\\nkeg exploded into all-out war. This was the \\x00rst world war because this\\nwas the \\x00rst time the world had become so small and so interconnected\\nthat most of the major parts of the world were involved in one way or\\nanother.\\nGiven the complexity and scale of World War I, and how extensively it has\\nbeen written about, I will just attempt to convey the big picture: it was terrible.\\nThe war killed about 8.5 million soldiers and 13 million civilians, leaving\\nall of Europe exhausted, weakened, and indebted. Russia devolved into\\nrevolution in 1917; in 1918, the Spanish \\x00u arrived, killing an estimated 20–50\\nmillion people around the world over the next two years. As a percentage of the\\nEuropean population, more people died during this period than in either the\\nNapoleonic Wars or Thirty Years’ War. But the war ended and the next new\\nworld order was created.\\nIn 1919, the victors—the US, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy—met\\nat the Paris Peace Conference to lay out the new world order in the\\nTreaty of Versailles. The United States, now recognized as a leading power,\\nplayed a big role in the negotiations. In fact, the term “new world order” was\\ncoined to describe US President Woodrow Wilson’s vision for a global\\ngovernance system (the League of Nations, though this quickly failed). If the\\nCongress of Vienna in 1815 had created a relatively sustainable order, the terms\\nof the Paris Peace Conference did the opposite— it made a second war inevitable\\nthough it wasn’t apparent at the time. The territories of the losing powers\\n(Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria) were carved\\nup, and they were forced to pay reparations to the victors. Those debt burdens\\ncontributed to an in\\x00ationary depression in Germany from 1920 to\\n1923. Elsewhere, much of the world entered a decade of peace and\\nprosperity, the Roaring ’20s. As is typical, the debts and the wealth gaps\\nthat were built up burst in 1929, causing the Great Depression. These\\ntwo big boom and bust cycles came unusually close together, though they\\nfollowed the classic stages. I won’t digress into the 1920s boom to bustsequence here as it was covered elsewhere in this book. But I will pick up\\nthe story in the Great Depression.\\nThe Great Depression coupled with the large wealth gaps led to a rise\\nin populism and extremism in nearly every major country. In some\\ncountries—e.g., the US and the UK—this led to big redistributions of\\nwealth and political power while capitalism and democracy were\\nmaintained. In others, particularly those with weaker economies\\n(Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain), populist dictators seized control and\\nsought to expand their empires.\\nClassically, before all-out wars begin, there is typically about a decade\\nof economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital skirmishing. The time\\nbetween the depression and World War II was consistent with this rule. As\\nGermany and Japan became more expansionist, they increasingly competed with\\nthe UK, the US, and France for resources and in\\x00uence over territories.\\nUltimately, those tensions boiled over into war.\\nWorld War II, just two decades after World War I, was even more\\ncostly in lives and money. Germany and Japan lost and the US, the UK,\\nand the Soviet Union won, though economically the UK and the Soviet\\nUnion lost too and the US gained enormously in relative wealth. GDP per\\ncapita in Germany and Japan fell by at least half, and their currencies collapsed in\\nthe aftermath of the war, as these charts show. As is typical, the winners of\\nthe war got together and determined a new world order in 1945.\\n9\\nTHE DECLINE\\nThe Allied victory in 1945 produced a tremendous shift of wealth and\\npower, with the US emerging as the world’s dominant empire just as the\\nBritish had after the Napoleonic Wars. The British were left with large debts,\\na huge empire that was more expensive to maintain than it was pro\\x00table,\\nnumerous rivals that were more competitive, and a population that had big\\nwealth gaps that led to big political gaps.\\nIt took another 20 years for the British pound to fully lose its status as\\nan international reserve currency. Just as the English language is so deeply\\nwoven into the fabric of international business and diplomatic communications\\nthat it would be di\\x00cult to replace, the same is true of reserve currencies. Other\\ncountries’ central banks continued to hold sizable shares of their reserves in\\npounds through the 1950s, and a third of all international trade was still\\ndenominated in sterling in 1960. But the pound had been losing status since\\nthe end of the war because smart investors recognized the great contrast\\nbetween the UK’s and the US’s \\x00nancial conditions, the UK’s increased debt\\nload, and the UK’s low net reserves, which would make holding pound sterling\\ndebt a bad deal.\\nThe decline in the British pound was a protracted a\\x00air that involved\\nseveral signi\\x00cant devaluations. After attempts to make the pound\\nconvertible failed in 1946–47, it was devalued by 30 percent against the dollar in\\n1949. Though this worked in the short term, over the next two decades Britain’sdeclining competitiveness led to repeated balance of payments strains that\\nculminated with the devaluation of 1967. Around this time the deutschemark\\ntook the pound’s place as the world’s second most widely held reserve currency.\\nThe following charts paint the picture.\\nThe P ound’ s Suspended Conv ertibility in 1947 and Its De valuation\\nin 1949\\nThe 1940s are frequently referred to as “crisis years” for the pound. The war\\nrequired the UK to borrow immensely from its allies and colonies, and thoseobligations were required to be held in sterling. When the war ended, the UK\\ncould not meet its debt obligations without either raising taxes or cutting\\ngovernment spending, so it necessarily mandated that its debt assets (i.e., its\\nbonds) could not be proactively sold by its former colonies. The US was anxious\\nfor the UK to restore convertibility as soon as possible, as the restrictions were\\nreducing liquidity in the global economy, a\\x00ecting the US’s export pro\\x00ts. The\\nBank of England was also eager to remove capital controls in order to restore the\\npound’s role as a global trading currency, increase \\x00nancial sector revenues in\\nLondon, and encourage international investors to continue saving in sterling. In\\n1946, an agreement was reached in which the US would provide the UK\\nwith a loan of $3.75 billion (about 10 percent of UK GDP) to o\\x00er a bu\\x00er\\nagainst a potential run on the pound. As expected, the pound came under\\nconsiderable selling pressure when partial convertibility was introduced in July\\n1947, and the UK and the Sterling Area countries turned to austerity to\\nmaintain the pound’s peg to the dollar. Restrictions were imposed on the\\nimport of luxury goods, defense expenditures were slashed, dollar and gold\\nreserves were drawn down, and agreements were made among sterling\\neconomies to not diversify their reserve holdings to the dollar. Prime Minister\\nClement Attlee gave a dramatic speech calling for the spirit of wartime sacri\\x00ce:\\nWe are engaged in another battle for Britain. This battle cannot be won by\\nthe few. It demands a united e\\x00ort by the whole nation. I am con\\x00dent\\nthat this united e\\x00ort will be forthcoming and that we shall again\\nconquer.\\nImmediately following the speech, the run on the pound accelerated. By the\\nend of August, convertibility was suspended, much to the anger of the\\nUS and other international investors who had bought sterling assets in\\nthe lead-up to convertibility. The governor of the National Bank of Belgium\\nthreatened to stop transacting in sterling, requiring a diplomatic intervention.\\nThe devaluation came two years later, as policy makers in both the UK\\nand the US realized that the pound couldn’t return to convertibility at\\nthe current rate. Competitiveness returned, the current account improved,and by the mid-to-late 1950s full convertibility was restored. The following\\ncharts paint the picture.\\nThe devaluation did not lead to a panic out of sterling, even though the\\nfundamentals remained poor, because a very large share of UK assets was held by\\nthe US government, which was willing to take the valuation hit in order to\\nrestore convertibility, and by Sterling Area economies, such as India and\\nAustralia, whose currencies were pegged to the pound for political reasons. Still,\\nthe immediate post-war experience made it clear to knowledgeable\\nobservers that the pound would not enjoy the same international role it\\nhad prior to World War II.\\nThe F ailed International E fforts to Suppor t the P ound in the 1950s\\nand 1960s and the De valuation of 1967\\nThough the 1949 devaluation helped in the short term, the pound faced\\nrecurring balance of payments strains. These were very concerning to\\ninternational policy makers, who feared that a collapse in the value of sterling or\\na rapid shift to the dollar could prove highly detrimental to the new BrettonWoods monetary system (particularly given the backdrop of the Cold War and\\nconcerns around communism). As a result, numerous e\\x00orts were made to\\nshore up the pound and preserve its role as a source of international\\nliquidity. In addition, the UK mandated that all trade within the Common\\nMarket would be denominated in pounds and all its currencies pegged to\\nsterling. The result was that for the 1950s and early 1960s, the UK was best\\nunderstood as a regional economic power and sterling as a regional reserve\\ncurrency. Yet those measures still didn’t \\x00x the problem: the UK was too\\nindebted and too uncompetitive; it couldn’t pay its debts and still buy what it\\nneeded to import. Sterling had to be devalued again in 1967. After that, even\\nSterling Area countries were unwilling to hold their reserves in pounds\\nunless the UK guaranteed their underlying value in dollars.\\nAfter the devaluation, little faith remained in the pound. Central banks\\nbegan to sell their sterling reserves and buy dollars, deutschemarks, and yen, as\\nopposed to simply accumulating fewer pounds in new reserve holdings. The\\naverage share of sterling in central bank reserve holdings collapsed within two\\nyears. Countries that continued to hold a high share of their reserves in\\npounds after 1968 were holding de facto dollars because the Sterling\\nAgreement of 1968 guaranteed 90 percent of their dollar value.\\nEurope after W orld W ar II\\nAs we’ve seen again and again, the terrible costs of war push countries to create\\nnew world orders in their aftermaths in an attempt to ensure that such wars can\\nnever happen again. Naturally, new world orders revolve around the victor,\\nwhich is often the newly ascendant empire. After World War II, that was clearly\\nthe US.\\nThe most important geopolitical elements of the post-war order were:\\nThe US was the dominant power, which made it the de facto global\\npolice force. Naturally, tensions almost immediately arose between the US\\nand the world’s second leading power, the Soviet Union. The US and its\\nallies formed a military alliance called NATO and the Soviet states formed\\nthe Warsaw Pact, and the two faced o\\x00 in the Cold War.\\nThe United Nations was established to resolve global disputes. As is\\nclassic, it was headquartered in the heart of the ascendant empire (in this\\ncase, New York), with its main power organ, the Security Council,\\ndominated by the war’s victors, as is also classic.\\nThe most important \\x00nancial elements of the new world order\\nconsisted of:\\nThe Bretton Woods monetary system, which established the dollar\\nas the world’s reserve currency.\\nThe IMF and the World Bank, designed to support the new global\\n\\x00nancial system.\\nNew York as the new global \\x00nancial center.\\nFrom the European perspective, the key aspect of the new world order\\nwas the shift from a balance of power in which the preeminent European\\npowers were on top to a world in which they were exhausted and\\novershadowed by new superpowers that dwarfed any one European state(especially as their colonies gained independence). Given these pressures and the\\nclear lesson of the costs of division that the World Wars had taught, the value of\\nEuropean unity was clear. That was the impetus for the new European order\\nthat gradually developed into the European Union.\\nThe story of Robert Schuman, a key founder of the EU, helps explain why\\nEurope came together. Schuman’s father was a French citizen who became a\\nGerman citizen when his home region of Alsace-Lorraine was annexed by the\\nGermans in 1871. Schuman was born a German citizen, but became a French\\ncitizen when Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France after World War I. As a\\npolitician in World War II, he joined the Vichy government before abandoning it\\nfor the French Resistance. He ended the war in hiding, with a 100,000\\nReichsmark bounty on his head. A key partner to Schuman was West Germany’s\\n\\x00rst post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. A centrist mayor, he had been\\ndriven from political life by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp in 1944.\\nFollowing his election as chancellor as a Christian Democrat in 1949, his policies\\nfocused on rebuilding the German economy, reconciling with other European\\npowers, and opposing communism. Schuman and Adenauer’s project, along\\nwith the rest of the EU’s founders, was to make war “not merely unthinkable,\\nbut materially impossible.”\\nTheir \\x00rst step was to create the European Coal and Steel Community. It\\nsounds like a narrow economic pact, but its explicit goal was to create a\\nEuropean federation. From the Schuman Declaration:\\nThe pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for\\nthe setting up of common foundations for economic development as a\\n\\x00rst step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of\\nthose regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of\\nmunitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims.\\nThe agreement created supranational bodies—a High Authority, a Common\\nAssembly, and a Court of Justice—that bound individual countries to its\\ndecisions and regulations, had the ability to levy taxes, could issue loans, and set\\nup programs for worker welfare. Six nations signed on, and more joined overtime. Eventually, it evolved into a customs union (in 1957, via the Treaty of\\nRome), opened up countries’ borders (in 1985, via the Schengen Agreement),\\nand eventually agreed on the framework for a political and economic union,\\nincluding a shared European citizenship (in 1992, via the Maastricht Treaty).\\nAs is classic, this new European geopolitical order came with a new\\n\\x00nancial/economic order. The Maastricht Treaty created the basis for a new\\ncommon currency (the euro) and common economic rules, including rules\\naround government de\\x00cits. The integration of its 27 member states (and their\\nmore than 400 million people), many of whom had been at war with one\\nanother in the past, is an impressive feat—one that puts the EU on a similar\\nstanding to the other great powers.\\nTHE EURO ZONE COMP ARED T O THE US AND CHIN A\\n\\xa0 EUR USA CHN\\nEmpir e Scor e (0 t o 1)* 0.55 0.87 0.75\\nGDP P er Capita (2017 USD , PPP\\nAdj)41,504 60,236 16,411\\nGDP (%WLD , PPP Adj) 13% 17% 23%\\nPopulation (%WLD) 4% 4% 18%\\nExpor ts (%WLD) 12% 11% 15%\\nMilitar y Spending (%WLD) 9% 28% 19%\\nCollege Gr ads (%WLD) 13% 20% 22%\\nPatents (%WLD) 11% 17% 41%\\nNobel Priz es (%WLD) 11% 32% 2%\\nEquity Mkt Cap (%WLD) 8% 55% 10%\\nIntl T ransactions in Curr ency\\n(%WLD)28% 55% 2%\\nOﬃcial Reser ves Held in Curr ency\\n(%WLD)21% 62% 2%\\n*Europe Empir e Arc treats major E urozone countries as of comparison.\\nThe European Union’s relative declines and crises in the early 21st century\\noccurred for the classic reasons Big Cycle declines occurred, which are re\\x00ectedin the eight measures of power and other indicators described in Chapter 2.\\nThese are the same reasons that other empires have experienced crises. More\\nspeci\\x00cally, Europe’s debt is large, its economy is fundamentally weak, its\\ninternal con\\x00icts are relatively large, its vitality and level of inventiveness are\\nrelatively weak, and its military is not strong. The wealth and income inequalities\\nbetween and within its member countries have fueled the rise of populists, many\\nof whom oppose the European Union, and who succeeded in causing the UK to\\nleave it. In short, from its position of a leading empire not long ago, Europe as a\\nwhole (and the UK with it) has slipped to a position of secondary power.\\nLet’s now turn our attentions to the American and Chinese powers.\\n1 This law created monopolistic joint-stock companies to trade in both the East and West Indies. Colbert’s\\nordinance was motivated by the desire to fund the trading companies using private funds, and not through\\nthe government.\\n2 The Treaty of Paris in 1814 saw France restore its borders to what they were in 1792, which meant France\\nactually got back some of the colonial territories that the UK had taken during the wars. The Treaty of Paris\\nin 1815, after Napoleon returned from exile and was defeated a second and \\x00nal time, was less favorable,\\nrequiring France to pay a large indemnity, accept an army of occupation, and cede some additional territory,\\nbut still left France with the vast majority of the land it had controlled at the time of the French\\nRevolution.\\n3 A crucial dimension of the UK’s early expansion was the role played by the British East India Company,\\nwhich starting in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century consolidated its political and\\neconomic control of modern-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This vast area remained under the\\nprivate control of the company until a major rebellion in 1857 led the British state to step in and take over\\nIndia as a British territory.4 While there were widespread private holdings of pounds internationally, it’s worth noting that for most of\\nthe 1800s there wasn’t much in the way of central bank holdings, particularly relative to the role that the\\ndollar plays in central bank portfolios today. Through World War I, central bank assets outside their own\\ncurrency were generally held in precious metals.\\n5 The Panic of 1866 demonstrates this well. To simplify the events, the London money markets were the\\nmost liquid markets for trade \\x00nance, but after a decade of boom lots of lenders were overextended and a\\nbig one (Overend, Gurney & Co.) went bust. It was the 19th century equivalent of Lehman Brothers.\\nHowever, the crisis resolved within days as the Bank of England’s demonstrated willingness to serve as the\\n“lender of last resort” stemmed the loss of con\\x00dence in the system.\\n6 GBR GDP share includes income of countries controlled by the British Empire.\\n7 For comparison, the top 1 percent’s share of wealth in the UK today is about 20 percent and the top 10\\npercent’s share is about 50 percent.\\n8 While Prussia, and later the German Empire, were monarchies ruled by the Hohenzollern family,\\nBismarck had immensely e\\x00ective powers, having been appointed by the monarch \\x00rst as minister president\\nof Prussia, and then as chancellor of Germany from uni\\x00cation in 1871 until 1890. According to historian\\nEric Hobsbawm, “[Bismarck] remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic\\nchess for almost twenty years after 1871.”\\n9 This chart shows the o\\x00cial exchange rate between dollars and deutschemarks as well as an uno\\x00cial\\n(black market) rate that was based on actual transactions between New York and Germany during that time\\nperiod. The uno\\x00cial rate shows that the true value of the deutschemark was collapsing during the period.CHAPTER 11\\nTHE BIG CYCLE RISE AND DECLINE OF\\nTHE UNITED STATES AND THE DOLLAR\\nThis chapter covers the Big Cycle rise of the US beginning in the 19th\\ncentury, its gradual surpassing of the UK as the world’s most powerful\\nempire, and its recent decline. As the story of the US as the world’s\\nleading empire is still unfolding and is highly relevant to the world\\ntoday, I will be going through its Big Cycle in more detail than I did for\\nthe Dutch and British, especially as it relates to the dollar’s status as a global\\nreserve currency and the economic and monetary policy forces that have\\nimpacted it.\\nThe chart on the next page shows the eight types of power that make up our\\noverall US arc. In them you can see the story behind the US’s rise and\\ndecline since 1700. The strong development and excellence in education led to\\nadvances in innovation and technology, competitiveness in world markets, and\\neconomic output, all of which fueled the development of \\x00nancial markets and\\nthe US as a \\x00nancial center, its leadership in military strength and world trade,\\nand, with a signi\\x00cant lag, the emergence of the dollar as a reserve currency. The\\nrelative advantages in education, competitiveness, and trade have fallen, while\\nthose in innovation and technology, reserve currency status, and \\x00nancial\\nmarkets and \\x00nancial center status remain strong. What this chart doesn’t\\nshow are the deviations in the US income and balance sheet conditions\\nand its internal con\\x00icts, both of which are more concerning. (For a more\\ncomplete current picture, see the \\x00nal chapter of this book.)This next chart combines all the factors to show the overall arc of the US\\nfrom before the Revolutionary War, marking the key events along the way. The\\nnumbers mark the approximate times of the six stages of the internal order cycle.\\nNow we will go through the US’s story from the beginning until the time of my\\nwriting.\\nTHE RISEAs with all new countries and dynasties, the US went through the usual\\nrevolution and post-revolution process in which it created a new\\ndomestic order as 1) a coordinated group of strong leaders fought to gain\\ncontrol, 2) that group won and consolidated control, 3) the new\\nleadership had a vision supported by the population, but 4) it split into\\nfactions that had con\\x00icts over how the government should work to\\nimplement that vision. Eventually, these factions 5) \\x00gured out the\\nsystem for control and laid it out in agreements (in the US case, at \\x00rst in\\nthe Articles of Confederation and then in the Constitution), 6) set up the\\nparts of government (e.g., the money and credit system, the legal system,\\nthe legislative systems, the military, etc.), and 7) put people in jobs and\\nmade it work well. The US did these things in a uniquely peaceful way\\nthrough negotiations, near-total respect for agreements, and good designs for\\ngovernance that gave it a great start.\\nIn the chart showing the eight types of power, you can see that rapidly\\nimproving levels of education preceded the big rises in innovation, technology,\\nand competitiveness, which lasted until the World Wars, with an interruption\\nduring the US Civil War. There were many ups and downs in both domestic and\\nexternal money/debt, economic, and military circumstances. I won’t take you\\nthrough them in detail, though I will note that all of them followed the\\narchetypical patterns driven by the same basic cause/e\\x00ect relationships\\npreviously described here. While the ascent of the US was most pronounced\\nafter World War II, it really started in the late 1800s. That’s where we’ll pick up\\nthe story.\\nAfter the US Civil War came the Second Industrial Revolution, which\\nwas one of those classic times in which the peaceful pursuit of wealth and\\nprosperity created great gains in incomes, technologies, and wealth in\\nEngland, continental Europe, and the United States.\\nIn the US, these gains were \\x00nanced through a system of free-market\\ncapitalism that, as is classic, produced both lots of wealth and big wealth\\ngaps. These gaps led to discontent and Progressive Era policies that broke up\\nrich and powerful monopolies (“trust busting”) and raised taxes on the rich,\\nstarting with the passage of a constitutional amendment to allow federal incometaxes in 1913. The US’s increased strengths were re\\x00ected in its rising shares of\\nglobal economic output and world trade, as well as its growing \\x00nancial strength\\n(exempli\\x00ed by New York becoming the world’s leading \\x00nancial center),\\ncontinuing leadership in innovation, and great usage of its \\x00nancial products.\\nThe Long Ascent of the Dollar and US Capital Mark ets\\nThe dollar’s path to being the world’s dominant reserve currency was far from\\nstraightforward. In the US’s \\x00rst century of existence its \\x00nancial system was\\ncompletely underdeveloped. Banking worked in the United States in the classic\\nways it did in most countries, as I described in Chapters 3 and 4. In other words,\\nhard money was put into banks that together lent out much more than they\\nhad. That Ponzi scheme unraveled, so banks failed to meet their commitments\\nand devalued the money. The US had no central bank to control \\x00nancial\\nmarkets or act as a lender of last resort. The US went through many\\nboom/bust cycles, in which classically a \\x00urry of debt-\\x00nanced\\ninvestments (into land, railroads, etc.) became overextended, leading to\\ncredit losses and a credit crunch. As a result, banking system panics were\\nextremely common. In New York alone, eight signi\\x00cant banking panics\\noccurred between 1836 and 1913, and regional banking panics were also\\ncommon. This was because the highly fragmented banking system had a rigid\\namount of currency, no deposit insurance, and a pyramidal reserve system (with\\na small number of large banks in New York serving as “correspondents” or\\nholding reserves for a high percentage of the nation’s banks) that heightened the\\nrisk of contagion from one bank going under.\\nLike London, New York was well-established as a trading center long\\nbefore it became a global \\x00nancial center, a development that didn’t\\noccur until after the turn of the 20th century. Only two US banks made the\\nlist of the top 20 largest global banks in 1913, at numbers 13 and 17. In\\ncomparison, British banks occupied nine slots, including three of the top \\x00ve.\\nFor perspective, at this point the US was far larger than the UK in economic\\noutput, and they were neck and neck in export market share.Many of the most important \\x00nancial innovations in the emerging\\nNew York \\x00nancial center came out of its needs as a large trading center.\\nInvestment banking took o\\x00 in the US and emerged in the 1800s as a\\nclearinghouse for capital—much of it \\x00owing from Europe—to  \\x00nance the US\\nboom over the period. Like in London earlier, insurance companies developed\\nmore rapidly than banking; in the pre-war period the large insurance trusts were\\nbigger than the large banks.\\nThe fact that the US economy was more dynamic and rapidly changing\\ncompared to European and British markets was also re\\x00ected in the US stock\\nmarket, which boomed starting right after the US Civil War. As previously\\nexplained, the second half of the 19th century was a boom period of peace\\nand prosperity that has been called “the Second Industrial Revolution,”\\n“the Gilded Age,” and “the Robber Barron Era” because it was the period\\nin which capitalism and innovation \\x00ourished, wealth gaps widened\\nenormously, decadence was apparent, and resentment built. The backlash\\nstarted around 1900, and there was a classic debt bust in 1907. This turbulence\\nled to the creation of the Federal Reserve central banking system in 1913. By\\n1910, US stock market capitalization had surpassed that of Great Britain. New\\nsectors and companies rose to prominence quickly, such as US Steel, which was\\nfounded in 1901 and became the most valuable US company only 15 years later.\\nThen World War I, the war few people expected to happen and\\nnobody expected to last so long, began in 1914 and ended in 1918. The\\nUS was not in World War I for most of it and was the only major country to\\nmaintain convertibility to gold during the war. Not only were the economies\\nand markets of Europe badly hurt from the wartime e\\x00orts, but the policies\\nundertaken by European governments also further undermined the faith in their\\ncurrencies. In contrast, the United States’ relative \\x00nancial and economic\\nposition bene\\x00ted from the war. That the Allies’ wartime debts were largely\\nowed to the US boosted the use of the dollar for denominating global\\ngovernment debt.\\nFollowing the standard script, the winning powers—in this case the\\nUS, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy—met after the war to set out the\\nnew world order. That meeting, called the Paris Peace Conference, tookplace in early 1919, lasted for six months, and led to the Treaty of\\nVersailles. In that treaty, the territories of the losing powers (Germany, Austria-\\nHungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria) were carved up and put under the\\ncontrol of the winning empires. The losing powers were put into deep debt to\\nthe winning powers to repay the winning countries’ war costs. These debts were\\npayable in gold.\\nGeopolitically, the United States also bene\\x00ted because it played a key role in\\nshaping the new world order, though it remained more isolationist while Britain\\ncontinued to expand and oversee its global colonial empire. The monetary\\nsystem in the immediate post-war period was in \\x00ux. While most countries\\nendeavored to restore gold convertibility, currency stability against gold came\\nonly after a period of sharp devaluations and in\\x00ation.\\nAs is typical, after the war years and with the new world order came a\\nperiod of peace and prosperity fueled by great innovations and\\nproductivity and a capital markets boom that produced big debts and big\\nwealth gaps late in the upswing. In the Roaring ’20s a lot of debt\\n(promises to deliver paper money that was convertible to gold) was\\ncreated to buy speculative assets (particularly stocks). To curtail that, the\\nFederal Reserve tightened monetary policy in 1929, which caused the\\nbubble to burst and the global Great Depression to begin. It brought\\neconomic su\\x00ering to virtually all nations, which led to \\x00ghting over\\nwealth within and between countries, which led to the hot wars that\\nbegan a decade later.I covered the events leading up to and during World War II in depth in\\nChapter 6 as an example of the war period of the big external order/disorder\\ncycle. The important thing to remember here is that the Allied victory in 1945\\nproduced the next shift in the world order. It was a tremendous shift of wealth\\nand power. On a relative basis the US came out the big winner because the\\nUS sold and lent a lot before and during the war, basically all of the\\n\\x00ghting took place o\\x00 of US territory so the US wasn’t physically\\ndamaged, and US deaths were comparatively low in relation to those of\\nmost other major countries.\\nTHE TOP\\nThe P ost-W ar Geopolitical and Militar y System\\nFollowing the standard script, the victorious powers met to determine\\nthe new world order and its new money and credit systems.\\nThe US, Russia (then the USSR), and Great Britain emerged from the\\n\\x00ghting as the world’s great powers with the US clearly the richest and most\\npowerful militarily. Germany, Japan, and Italy were largely destroyed; Great\\nBritain was essentially bankrupt, and France was devastated by the war and\\ncontributed little to the victory. China was in civil war, which resumed right\\nafter Japan’s surrender. While there was relatively good cooperation\\nbetween the US and Russia immediately after the war, it didn’t take long\\nfor the two greatest powers with opposing ideologies to enter a “cold”\\nwar. The next chart shows the aggregate power indices for the US, the UK,\\nRussia, and China since the end of World War II. As you can see, Russia rose\\nrelative to the US until 1980 but it was never nearly as powerful, though it was\\nmuch more powerful than China. After 1980, Russia began its decline while\\nChina then began its rapid ascent and the US continued its gradual decline.The split between the US- and Russian-controlled blocs had been clear from\\nthe outset. President Harry Truman outlined what is now referred to as the\\nTruman Doctrine in a March 1947 speech:\\nEvery nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is\\ntoo often not a free one. One way of life is based upon the will of the\\nmajority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative\\ngovernment, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of\\nspeech and religion, and freedom from political oppression. The second\\nway of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the\\nmajority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio,\\n\\x00xed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. I believe that it\\nmust be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are\\nresisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside\\npressures.\\nAs I explained in Chapter 6, compared to domestic governance, \\n international\\nrelations are driven much more by raw power dynamics.  That is because there are\\nlaws and standards of behavior within countries, whereas between them\\nraw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed-upon\\ntreaties and organizations for arbitration (such as the League of Nations,the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization) don’t matter\\nmuch. That is what makes having a strong military and strong military\\nalliances so important. In 1949, 12 countries in the US camp (with more\\njoining later) formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military\\nalliance, and in 1954 the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was\\nestablished among the US, the UK, Australia, France, New Zealand, the\\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Pakistan. Eight countries in the Soviet camp formed\\nthe Warsaw Pact in 1955.\\nAs shown in the following chart, the Americans and Soviets invested\\nmassively in building up their nuclear weapons and a number of other\\ncountries followed. Today, 11 countries have nuclear weapons or are on the\\nbrink of having them, in varying amounts and degrees of capability. Having\\nnuclear weapons obviously gives one a big negotiating chip in the world power\\ngame, so it’s understandable why some countries would want to have them and\\nother countries would not want other countries to have them. While there have\\nbeen no nuclear wars, the US has fought a number of conventional wars since\\nWorld War II, most notably the Korean War in the 1950s, the Vietnam War in\\nthe 1960s and 1970s, the two Gulf Wars in 1990 and 2003, and the War in\\nAfghanistan from 2001 to 2021. These were costly in terms of money, lives, and\\npublic support for the United States. Were they worth it? That’s for others to\\ndecide. For the Soviet Union, which had a much smaller and weaker economy\\nthan the US, spending enough to compete with the US militarily and maintain\\nits empire pushed it into bankruptcy.\\nOf course, military power consists of a lot more than nuclear weapons and a\\nlot has changed since the Cold War. While I’m no military expert, I get to speakto some who have led me to believe that, while the US remains the strongest\\nmilitary power overall, it is not dominant in all parts of the world in all ways, and\\nmilitary challenges to it are rising. There is a signi\\x00cant chance that the US\\nwould lose wars against China and Russia in their geographic areas of strength—\\nor at least would be unacceptably harmed—and it could also be unacceptably\\nharmed by some second-tier powers too. This is not the good ol’ days of right\\nafter 1945 when the US was the sole dominant power. While there are a number\\nof high-risk scenarios, in my opinion, the most worrying is a forceful move by\\nChina to bring Taiwan under its control.\\nWhat will the next high-stakes military con\\x00ict look like? Because of new\\ntechnologies, it will be very di\\x00erent from previous ones. Classically the country\\nthat wins wars spends more, invests more, and outlasts the opposition. But it is a\\ndelicate balance.\\n Because spending on the militar y takes government mone y away from spending on\\nsocial programs, and because militar y technologies go hand in hand with private sect or\\ntechnologies, the biggest militar y risk for the leading powers is that they lose the economic\\nand technology wars.\\nIn dealings between countries the transactions are more at arm’s length. That\\nmeans it is less easy to make the currency arti\\x00cially cheap, harming the holders\\nof it, so internationally traded currencies are more likely to be better value\\ncurrencies. This is relevant when currencies are a storehold of wealth in the form\\nof debt denominated in them. Sometimes there is too much debt around the\\nworld and it is in all governments’ interests to devalue their currencies. At such\\ntimes gold (and recently digital currencies) can be preferable. Also at such times\\ngovernments are more likely to outlaw these alternative currencies, though they\\ncan’t fully outlaw them. When the money and credit systems based on \\x00at\\ncurrencies break down, it eventually leads to hard money monetary systems.\\nThe P ost-W ar Monetar y and E conomic Systems\\nAs for the new post-war monetary and economic systems, there was one\\nfor the US-led camp and one for the Soviet-led camp, though there were\\nalso some nonaligned countries that had their own nonaligned currencies thatwere not widely accepted. Representatives of 44 countries gathered in Bretton\\nWoods, New Hampshire, in 1944 to make a monetary system that linked the\\ndollar to gold and other country’s currencies to the dollar. The Soviet Union’s\\nsystem was built around the ruble, which nobody wanted. \\n Transactions between\\ncountries are very different from transactions within countries.  Governments want to\\ncontrol the money that is used within their borders because by increasing and\\ndecreasing its supply, its cost of borrowing, and its value the government has\\nenormous power.\\nBecause money and economics are so important I want to return to the\\nsubject, revisiting how the system works and is working. In the post-war\\nmonetary system, within countries, people and companies used the government-\\ncontrolled paper money. When they wanted to buy something from\\nanother country, they typically exchanged their own country’s paper\\ncurrency for the other country’s paper currency with the help of their\\ncentral bank that settled with the other country’s central bank in gold. If\\nthey were American, they paid in dollars and the seller from another country\\neither exchanged them at their central bank for the local currency or held on to\\nthem believing that they were better storeholds of wealth than their own money.\\nThe results were that gold left the US central bank’s reserve account and went\\ninto the accounts of other country’s central bank and dollars accumulated\\nabroad.\\nAs a result of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the dollar became the\\nworld’s leading reserve currency. This was natural because the two World\\nWars had made the US the richest and most powerful country by far. By\\nthe end of World War II the US had amassed its greatest gold/money savings ever\\n—about two-thirds of all the government-held gold/money in the world, the\\nequivalent to eight years of import purchases. Even after the war, it continued to\\nearn a lot of money by exporting.\\nThe economies of Europe and Japan had been destroyed by the war. As\\na solution, and to \\x00ght the spread of communism, the US supplied them\\nwith massive aid packages (known as the Marshall and Dodge plans),\\nwhich were a) good for these devastated nations, b) good for the US\\neconomically because these countries used the money to buy US goods, c)good for the US’s geopolitical in\\x00uence, and d) good for reinforcing the\\ndollar’s position as the world’s dominant reserve currency.\\nAs for monetary policy, from 1933 until 1951, the amount of money, the cost\\nof money (i.e., interest rates), and where that money went was controlled by the\\nFederal Reserve to serve the greater objectives of the country rather than the free\\nmarket.1 More speci\\x00cally, the Fed printed a lot of money to buy debt, capped\\ninterest rates that lenders could charge, and controlled what money was allowed\\nto go into, so high in\\x00ation did not drive interest rates to unacceptable heights\\nand government regulations prevented other investment options from becoming\\nmuch more attractive than the debt the government wanted people to save in.\\nFollowing a brief post-war recession that was due to the decline of\\nmilitary spending, the US entered a prolonged period of peace and\\nprosperity as is typical when a new Big Cycle begins.\\nThe post-war recession saw the unemployment rate double (to around 4\\npercent), as around 20 million people needed to \\x00nd employment outside of the\\nmilitary and other adjacent jobs. But at the same time, the removal of rationing\\nlaws, which had limited people’s ability to buy consumer goods, fueled a\\nconsumer spending surge. Cheap mortgages were also available for veterans,\\nwhich led to a housing boom. The return to pro\\x00t-making activities raised the\\ndemand for labor, so employment rebounded very quickly. Exports were strong\\nbecause the Marshall and Dodge plans fueled foreign appetite for US goods; also\\nthe US private sector went global and invested abroad from 1945 through the\\n1970s. Stocks were cheap and dividend yields were high; the result was a\\nmultidecade bull market that reinforced New York’s dominance as the world’s\\n\\x00nancial center, bringing in still more investment and further strengthening the\\ndollar as a reserve currency. All of this was classic; it was a mutually self-\\nreinforcing Big Cycle upswing.\\nThere was enough money for the US to improve education, invent\\nfabulous technologies (e.g., those that allowed it to go to the moon), and\\na lot more. The stock market hit its high in 1966, which marked the end\\nof the good times for 16 years, though nobody knew it then. That was\\naround the time that my own direct contact with events began. I started\\ninvesting in 1961 at age 12. Of course, I didn’t know what I was doing and hadno appreciation for how lucky my contemporaries and I were. I was born at the\\nright time and in the right place. The United States was the leading\\nmanufacturing country, so labor was valuable. Most adults could get a good job,\\nand their kids could get a college education and rise without limitation. Since the\\nmajority of people were middle class, the majority of people were happy.\\nThe US did all the classic things that helped the world become more\\ndollarized. Its banks increased their operations and lending in foreign markets.\\nIn 1965, only 13 US banks had foreign branches. By 1970, 79 banks had them,\\nand by 1980 nearly every major US bank had at least one foreign branch, and the\\ntotal number of branches had grown to 787. Global lending boomed. However,\\nas is also typical, a) those who prospered overdid things by operating \\x00nancially\\nimprudently while b) global competition, especially from Germany and Japan,\\nincreased. As a result, American lending and America’s \\x00nances began to\\ndeteriorate as its trade surpluses disappeared.\\nAmericans never thought about how much the space program, the\\nWar on Poverty, and the Vietnam War would cost. Because they felt so\\nrich and the dollar seemed secure as a reserve currency Americans\\nassumed they could a\\x00ord a “guns and butter” \\x00scal policy inde\\x00nitely.\\nAs the 1960s came to a close, real GDP growth was near 0 percent, in\\x00ation was\\naround 6 percent, the short-term government interest rate was around 8 percent,\\nand unemployment was around 4 percent. During this decade, US stocks\\nreturned 8 percent on an annual basis while bonds trailed, with equity-volatility-\\nmatched bonds returning -3 percent annually. The o\\x00cial gold price remained\\n\\x00xed in dollar terms, with some modest market price appreciation later in the\\ndecade, and commodities continued to be weak, returning 1 percent annually.\\nThe 1970s: The Balance of P ayments Pr oblem Unfolds—Low\\nGrowth, High Inﬂation\\nAs explained in Chapter 3, when claims on hard money (i.e., notes or paper\\nmoney) are introduced, at \\x00rst there is the same number of claims on the hard\\nmoney as there is hard money in the bank. However, the holders of the paper\\nclaims and the banks soon discover the wonders of credit and debt. Debt holderslike it because they can lend these paper claims to the bank in exchange for an\\ninterest payment so they get interest. The banks that borrow it from them like it\\nbecause they can lend the money to others, who pay a higher interest rate so the\\nbanks make a pro\\x00t. Those who borrow the money from the bank like it because\\nit gives them buying power that they didn’t have. And the whole society likes it\\nbecause asset prices and productivity rise.\\nAfter 1945, foreign central banks had the option of holding interest-rate-\\npaying debt or holding non-interest-rate-earning gold. Because dollar-\\ndenominated debt was considered as good as gold, was convertible to gold, and\\nwas higher-earning because it provided interest, central banks shrank their gold\\nholdings relative to their dollar-denominated debt holdings from 1945 until\\n1971. As explained in Chapter 4, investors making such a move is a classic\\nbehavior and ends when a) the claims on the real money (i.e., gold)\\nsubstantially exceed the amount of real money in the bank and b) one can\\nsee that the amount of real money in the bank (i.e., gold reserves) is going\\ndown. That is when no interest rate can be high enough for it to make\\nsense to hold the debt (i.e., claims on the hard money) rather than to turn\\none’s paper money in for gold. At that time a run on the bank occurs and\\na default and debt restructuring have to happen. That is what led to the\\nbreakdown of the gold-linked Bretton Woods monetary system.\\nAs in\\x00ation accelerated and the economy weakened in 1969–70, the Fed\\ncould not a\\x00ord to maintain a tight monetary policy, so the US’s balance of\\npayments worsened and the dollar took a nosedive. Rather than running\\nsurpluses, the US ran unsustainably huge balance of payments de\\x00cits (i.e., the\\nUS bought more from the rest of the world than it sold to the rest of the world).\\nIn the summer of 1971, Americans traveling in Europe had di\\x00culty exchanging\\ntheir dollars for German marks, French francs, and British pounds. The Nixon\\nadministration vowed not to “devalue” the dollar, but in August 1971,\\nthe US defaulted on its commitments to pay in gold, o\\x00ering paper\\nmoney instead. Money and credit growth were no longer constrained, and the\\ndecade of stag\\x00ation had begun. At the same time, other industrialized countries\\nhad regained their economic strength, becoming very competitive in the world\\nmarkets.Rather than seeing these problems as signs of things to come,\\nAmericans viewed them as nothing more than a temporary setback. Yet\\nas the decade progressed, economic problems contributed to political\\nproblems and vice versa. The Vietnam War and the Watergate a\\x00air dragged\\non, and there were OPEC-induced oil price increases and drought-induced food\\nprice hikes. As costs rose, Americans borrowed more in order to maintain their\\nlifestyles, and the Fed allowed accelerated money supply growth to\\naccommodate the high borrowing and prevent unacceptably high interest rates.\\nThe dollars these de\\x00cits produced went to countries that were running\\nbudget surpluses, which deposited them in American banks, which lent them to\\nLatin American and other emerging, commodity-producing countries. Savings\\nand loan associations borrowed short to make longer-term mortgages and other\\nloans, using the positive spread between short rates (which they borrowed at)\\nand long rates (which they lent at) as a source of pro\\x00ts. In\\x00ation and its e\\x00ects\\non markets came in two big waves that were bracketed by periods of extreme\\nmonetary tightness, steep stock market declines, and deep recessions. Early in\\nthe 1970s, most Americans had never experienced in\\x00ation, so they\\nweren’t wary of it and allowed it to blossom. By the end of the decade,\\nthey were traumatized by it and assumed that it would never go away.\\nBy the end of the 1970s real GDP growth was around 2 percent, in\\x00ation was\\naround 14 percent, short-term interest rates were around 13 percent, and\\nunemployment was around 6 percent. Over the decade, gold surged and\\ncommodities kept up with rising in\\x00ation, returning around 30 percent and 15\\npercent on an annualized basis, respectively. But the high rate of in\\x00ation wiped\\nout the modest 5 percent annual nominal return for stocks and 4 percent return\\nfor treasuries matched to equity volatility.\\nThe P ost-Br etton W oods System\\nAfter the 1971 delinking of the dollar and other currencies from gold,\\nthe world moved to an unanchored \\x00at monetary system (or, Type 3, as I\\nexplained in Chapter 3) and the dollar fell in value against gold, other\\ncurrencies, stocks, and eventually just about everything. The newmonetary system was negotiated by the leading economic policy makers of the\\nUnited States, Germany, and Japan.2 Paul Volcker was Nixon’s undersecretary of\\ninternational monetary a\\x00airs when Nixon severed the link with gold, and he\\nwas head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 until 1987. He did more to shape\\nand guide the dollar-based monetary system before, during, and after these years\\nthan anyone. I was lucky enough to know him well so I can personally attest that\\nhe was a person of great character, capabilities, in\\x00uence, and humility—a classic\\nhero/role model in a world that lacks hero/role models, especially in economic\\npublic service. I believe that he and his thinking deserve to be studied more.\\nI remember the in\\x00ation psychology of that time very well; it led\\nAmericans to borrow money and immediately take their paychecks to\\nbuy things to “get ahead of in\\x00ation.” They also bought things that you\\ncouldn’t make more of, like gold and waterfront properties. The panic out of\\ndollar debt also led interest rates to rise and drove the gold price from the $35\\nthat it was \\x00xed at in 1944 and o\\x00cially stayed at until 1971 to $850 in 1980.\\nWhile most people didn’t understand how the money and credit dynamic\\nworked, they felt the pain of it in the form of high in\\x00ation and high interest\\nrates, so it was a chronic political issue. At the same time, there was a lot of\\ncon\\x00ict and rebellion due to the war in Vietnam, oil embargoes that led to high\\ngas prices and gas rationing, labor union \\x00ghts with companies over wages and\\nbene\\x00ts, Watergate and the Nixon impeachment, etc. These problems peaked in\\nthe late 1970s when 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days at the US\\nEmbassy in Tehran. Americans felt that the country was falling apart. But what\\nmost Americans didn’t understand was that economic conditions in communist\\ncountries were even worse.\\nAs we’ll see in the next chapter, Mao Zedong’s death in 1976 brought\\nDeng Xiaoping to power in a China that was stumbling economically\\nand facing internal con\\x00ict. Deng’s market reforms led to a shift in\\neconomic policies that included capitalist elements like private\\nownership of businesses, the development of debt and equities markets,\\nentrepreneurial technological and commercial innovations, and even the\\n\\x00ourishing of billionaire capitalists—all under the strict control of the\\nChinese Communist Party. This shift in leadership and approaches,while seemingly insigni\\x00cant at the time, would germinate into the\\nbiggest single force to shape the 21st century.\\nThe 1979–1982 Mo ve to Tight Mone y and Conser vatism\\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who like most political leaders didn’t understand the\\nmonetary mechanics very well, knew that something had to be done to stop\\nin\\x00ation and appointed a strong monetary policy maker (Volcker) as head of the\\nFederal Reserve in August 1979. In October 1979, Volcker announced that he\\nwould constrain money (M1) growth at 5.5 percent. I ran the numbers,\\nwhich led me to \\x00gure that, if he really did what he said he was going to do, there\\nwould be a great shortage of money that would send interest rates through the\\nroof, bankrupting debtors who could not get the credit they needed to cover\\ntheir debt-service expenses. Volcker stuck to the plan despite great political\\nbacklash, driving interest rates to the highest levels seen “since Jesus Christ,”\\naccording to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\\nIn the 1980 presidential election Carter was voted out and Ronald\\nReagan, who was perceived as a conservative who would impose\\ndiscipline where it was needed, was elected. Leading countries at the time\\n(re\\x00ected in the G7, which consisted of the US, the UK, Germany, Japan,\\nFrance, Italy, and Canada—which shows how di\\x00erent the world power\\nbalance was 40 years ago versus today) made analogous moves in electing\\nconservatives to bring discipline to their in\\x00ationary chaos. Early in their\\nterms, both Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK had landmark\\n\\x00ghts with labor unions.\\n Economics and politics have swings between the left and the right in varying extremes\\nas the excesses of each become intolerable and the memories of the problems of the other\\nfade.  It’s like fashion—the widths of ties and the lengths of skirts change\\nthrough time. When there is great popularity of one extreme, one should\\nexpect that it won’t be too long before there will be a comparable move\\nin the opposite direction. The move to monetary tightness broke the backs of\\ndebtors and curtailed borrowing, which drove the world economy into its worst\\ndownturn since the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve slowly started to cutinterest rates, but the markets continued to decline. Then Mexico defaulted on\\nits debt in August 1982. Interestingly, the US stock market rallied in response.\\nWhat happened next created a jarringly painful learning experience for me.\\nWhile I was able to anticipate the debt crisis, which was pro\\x00table for me, it also\\nled me a) to anticipate a debt-default-triggered depression that never came and\\nb) to lose a lot of money betting on it. As a result of my personal losses and the\\nlosses of clients, I had to let everyone in my \\x00edgling company, Bridgewater\\nAssociates, go and was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad to help pay\\nmy family’s bills. At the same time this was one of the best things that ever\\nhappened to me because it changed my whole approach to decision making.\\nWhat I had missed was that when debts are in the currencies that central banks\\nhave the ability to print and restructure, debt crises can be well-managed so they\\nare not systemically threatening. Because the Federal Reserve could provide\\nmoney to the banks that made the loans that weren’t being paid back, they\\ndidn’t have a cash \\x00ow problem, and because the American accounting system\\ndidn’t require the banks to account for these bad debts as losses, there was no big\\nproblem that couldn’t be worked out. I learned that the value of assets is the\\nreciprocal of the value of money and credit (i.e., the cheaper money and\\ncredit are, the more expensive asset prices are) and the value of money is\\nthe reciprocal of the quantity of it in existence, so when central banks are\\nproducing a lot of money and credit and making it cheaper, it is wise to\\nbe more aggressive in owning assets.\\nThe Disinﬂationar y and Booming 1980s\\nIn the 1980s there was a stock market and economic boom that was\\naccompanied by falling in\\x00ation and falling interest rates in the United States at\\nthe same time as there were in\\x00ationary depressions in the debt-burdened\\nemerging economies that didn’t have central banks to bail them out. The debt-\\nrestructuring process progressed slowly from 1982 until 1989 when an\\nagreement called the Brady Plan, named after Nicholas Brady, who was the US\\nTreasury secretary at the time, was created and started to bring an end to the\\n“lost decade” in these countries (as agreements were reached with di\\x00erentcountries through the early ’90s). This whole 1971–91 up-and-down debt\\ncycle, which profoundly a\\x00ected just about everyone in the world, was\\nthe result of the US going o\\x00 the gold standard, the in\\x00ation that\\nfollowed it, and having to break the back of the in\\x00ation through tight\\nmonetary policies that led to the strength in the dollar and the dramatic\\nfall in in\\x00ation. In the markets that big cycle showed up via a) the soaring of\\nin\\x00ation and in\\x00ation-hedge assets and bear markets in bonds in the 1970s, b)\\nthe 1979–81 bone-crushing monetary tightening that made cash the best\\ninvestment and led to a lot of de\\x00ationary debt restructuring by non-American\\ndebtors, and then c) falling in\\x00ation rates and excellent performance of bonds,\\nstocks, and other disin\\x00ationary assets in the 1980s. The following charts convey\\nthis very well, as they show the swings up and down in dollar-denominated\\nin\\x00ation rates and interest rates from 1945 to the present. One needs to keep\\nthese moves and the mechanics behind them in mind when thinking about the\\nfuture.\\nThrough it all, the dollar remained the world’s leading reserve currency. The\\nentire period was a forceful demonstration of the bene\\x00ts to the US of having\\nthe currency that most of the world’s debts are denominated in.\\n1990–2008: Globalizing, Digitalizing, and Booming Financed b y\\nDebt\\nBecause of its economic failures, the Soviet Union could not a\\x00ord to\\nsupport a) its empire, b) its economy, and c) its military in the face ofReagan’s arms-race spending. As a result, the Soviet Union broke down in\\n1991. It was apparent that communism had failed or was failing everywhere, so\\nmany countries moved away from it and the world entered a very prosperous\\nperiod of globalization and free-market capitalism.\\nSince then, three economic cycles have brought us to where we are at\\nthe time of my writing—one that peaked in the 2000 dot-com bubble\\nthat led to the recession that followed, one that peaked in the 2007\\nbubble that led to the 2008 global \\x00nancial crisis, and one that peaked in\\n2019, just before the 2020 coronavirus-triggered downturn. In addition\\nto the decline of the Soviet Union, this period also saw the rise of China,\\nglobalization, and advances in technologies that replaced people, which\\nwas good for corporate pro\\x00ts but widened wealth and opportunity\\ngaps.\\nCountries and their borders faded in importance; goods and the incomes\\nthey produced were generally made wherever they could be most cost-e\\x00ectively\\nproduced, which led to production and development in emerging countries,\\naccelerating mobility of people between countries, narrowing wealth gaps\\nbetween countries, and ballooning wealth gaps within them. Lower- and middle-\\nincome workers in developed countries su\\x00ered, while workers in productive\\nemerging countries saw big relative gains. Though a bit of an oversimpli\\x00cation,\\nit’s accurate to say that this was a period in which workers in other\\ncountries, especially those in China, and machines replaced middle-class\\nworkers in the United States.\\nThe following chart shows the balances of goods and services3 for the United\\nStates and China since 1990 in real (i.e., in\\x00ation-adjusted) dollars. As you will\\nsee when we look at China in the next chapter, China’s economic reforms and\\nopen-door policies after Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and China’s\\nbeing welcomed into the World Trade Organization in 2001 led to an explosion\\nof Chinese competitiveness and exports. Note the accelerations in Chinese\\nsurpluses and the US de\\x00cits from around 2000 to around 2010 and then some\\nnarrowing of these di\\x00erences (which have recently ticked up during the\\npandemic), with China still tending to run surpluses and the US still runningde\\x00cits. These surpluses have given China big savings that are a great \\x00nancial\\npower.\\n Most people pay attention to what they get and not wher e the mone y comes from to\\npay for it, so there are strong motiv ations for elected oﬃcials to spend a lot of borrowed\\nmone y and mak e a lot of promises to give voters what they want and to take on debt and\\nnon-debt liabilities that cause problems down the road. That was certainly the case in\\nthe 1990–2008 period.\\nThroughout the long-term debt cycle, from 1945 until 2008, whenever the\\nFederal Reserve wanted the economy to pick up it would lower interest rates and\\nmake money and credit more available, which would increase stock and bond\\nprices and increase demand. That was how it was done until 2008—i.e., interest\\nrates were cut, and debts were increased faster than incomes to create\\nunsustainable bubbles. That changed when the bubble burst in 2008 and\\ninterest rates hit 0 percent for the \\x00rst time since the Great Depression. As\\nexplained more comprehensively in my book Principles for Navigating Big Debt\\nCrises there are three types of monetary policy: 1) interest-rate-driven monetary\\npolicy (which I call Monetary Policy 1 because it is the \\x00rst to be used and is the\\npreferable way to run monetary policy), 2) printing money and buying \\x00nancial\\nassets, most importantly bonds (which I call Monetary Policy 2 and is now\\npopularly called “quantitative easing”), and 3) coordination between \\x00scal policy\\nand monetary policy in which the central government does a lot of debt-\\n\\x00nanced spending and the central bank buys that debt (which I call Monetary\\nPolicy 3 because it is the third and last approach to be used when the \\x00rst twocease to be e\\x00ective). The next charts show how the debt crises of 1933 and 2008\\nboth led to interest rates hitting 0 percent and were followed by big money\\nprinting by the Federal Reserve.\\nThis change in monetary policy had big e\\x00ects and implications.\\nThe 2008–2020 Mone y-Financed Capitalist Boom\\nIn 2008 the debt crisis led to interest rates being lowered until they hit 0\\npercent, which led the three main reserve currency central banks (led by the\\nFed) to move from an interest-rate-driven monetary policy to a monetary policy\\nof printing money and buying \\x00nancial assets. Central banks printed money and\\nbought \\x00nancial assets, which put money in the hands of investors who bought\\nother \\x00nancial assets, which caused \\x00nancial asset prices to rise, which was\\nhelpful for the economy and particularly bene\\x00cial to those who were rich\\nenough to own \\x00nancial assets, so it increased the wealth gap. Basically,\\nborrowed money was essentially free, so investment borrowers and corporate\\nborrowers took advantage of this to get it and used it to make purchases that\\ndrove stock prices and corporate pro\\x00ts up. This money did not trickle downproportionately, so wealth and income gaps continued to grow. Wealth and\\nincome gaps grew to the largest since the 1930–45 period.\\nIn 2016, Donald Trump, a blunt-speaking businessman and\\ncapitalist/populist of the right, led a revolt against establishment\\npoliticians and “elites” to get elected president by promising to support\\npeople with conservative values who had lost jobs and were struggling.\\nHe went on to cut corporate taxes and run big budget de\\x00cits that the Fed\\naccommodated. While this debt growth \\x00nanced relatively strong market-\\neconomy growth and created some improvements for lower-income earners, it\\nwas accompanied by a further widening of the wealth and values gap, leading the\\n“have-nots” to become increasingly resentful of the “haves.” At the same time,\\nthe political gap grew with increasingly extreme Republicans on the one\\nside and increasingly extreme Democrats on the other. This is re\\x00ected in\\nthe next two charts. The \\x00rst one shows how conservative Republicans in the\\nSenate and House and how liberal Democrats in the Senate and House have\\nbecome relative to the past. Based on this measure they have become more\\nextreme, and their divergence has become larger than ever before. While I’m not\\nsure that’s exactly right, I think it’s by and large right.The next chart shows the percentage of votes along party lines for the average\\nrepresentative, which is the highest ever. This continues to be re\\x00ected in the\\nreduced willingness to cross party lines to compromise and reach agreements. In\\nother words, the political splits in the country have become deep and\\nintransigent.\\nTrump took a more aggressive negotiating posture concerning\\neconomic and geopolitical disagreements with international rivals,\\nparticularly China and Iran, and allies such as Europe and Japan\\nregarding trade and paying for military expenditures. The con\\x00icts with\\nChina over trade, technology, geopolitics, and capital were intensifying as his\\nterm ended in 2021; economic sanctions such as those that were used in the\\n1930–45 period were being used or put on the table for possible use.\\nIn March 2020 the coronavirus pandemic hit, and incomes,\\nemployment, and economic activity plunged as the country (and much ofthe world) went into lockdown. The US government took on a lot of debt\\nto give people and companies a lot of money, and the Federal Reserve\\nprinted a lot of money and bought a lot of debt. So did other central\\nbanks. As a re\\x00ection of this, the following charts show the unemployment\\nrates and central bank balance sheets of major countries for as far back as data is\\navailable. As shown, all the levels of central banks’ printing of money and buying\\nof \\x00nancial assets rose to near or beyond the previous record amounts in the war\\nyears.\\nAs history has shown and as explained in Chapter 4, \\n when there is a\\ngreat increase in money and credit, it drives down the value of mone y and credit, which\\ndrives up the v alue of other inv estment assets.\\nThe printing and buying of debt that the Fed undertook in 2020 was much\\nlike Roosevelt’s March 1933 move, Nixon’s August 1971 move, Volcker’s\\nAugust 1982 move, Ben Bernanke’s November 2008 move, and Mario Draghi’s\\nJuly 2012 move. It has become standard operating procedure for central banks,\\nand it will persist until it no longer works.\\nWHERE THE US IS NOW IN ITS BIG CYCLE\\nThe stats in my model suggest that the US is roughly 70 percent through\\nits Big Cycle, plus or minus 10 percent. The United States has not yet\\ncrossed the line into the sixth phase of a civil war/revolution, when the\\nactive \\x00ghting begins, but internal con\\x00ict is high and rising. The recent\\nelections show how split the country is—almost 50/50, along seemingly\\nirreconcilable lines.\\nThe next graphic represents what the population looked like 50 years ago—\\ni.e., the majority of each party were moderates and the extremists were less\\nextreme.\\nNow it looks like this—i.e., with a greater concentration and number of\\npeople at the extremes.\\n 4\\nHistory has shown us that \\n greater polarization equals either  a) greater  risk of\\npolitical gridlock, which reduces the chances of revolutionar y changes that rectify the\\nproblems or b) some form of civil war/r evolution.\\nIn Chapter 5, I described the classic markers signaling the probabilities of\\nescalation from Stage 5 to Stage 6. The three most important markers I am\\nwatching now are: 1) the rules being disregarded, 2) both sides\\nemotionally attacking each other, and 3) blood being spilled.\\nIn the \\x00nal chapter of this book, I will share the quantitative measures that I\\nuse to track how things are going. I will continue to watch these and share what\\nI’m seeing with you at economicprinciples.org. But \\x00rst, we will look at a rising\\nworld power, China, and the ways in which it is coming into con\\x00ict with the\\nUS.\\n1 While 1933 to 1951 was the period from the Roosevelt peg break to the Monetary Accord between the\\nFederal Reserve and Treasury, the policy of explicit yield curve control, in which the Federal Reserve\\ncontrolled the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates, lasted from 1942 to 1947.\\n2 If you want to read a great description of this process of \\x00guring out how to go from the old monetary\\nsystem to the new \\x00at one, I recommend Changing Fortunes by Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten.\\n3 This measures whether the country as a whole is spending more than it’s earning.\\n4 Shading indicates degree of polarization.CHAPTER 12\\nTHE BIG CYCLE RISE OF CHINA AND\\nTHE RENMINBI\\nEmotions have been running so high between the US and China that many\\npeople have urged me not to publish this chapter. We are in a kind of war, they\\nsay; any complimentary things you write about China will alienate US readers,\\nwhile criticism of China will infuriate the Chinese—and the media will make\\nthings worse by distorting everything you say. That’s probably true, but I can’t\\nnot speak openly because the US-China relationship is too important to be left\\nunmentioned by anyone who knows both countries as well as I do. To not speak\\nhonestly would cost me my self-respect.\\nI’m not afraid of criticism; I welcome it. What I am passing along here is just\\nthe latest iteration of my learning process, which is to develop my perspectives\\nthrough direct experiences and research, to write up what I learn, to stress test it\\nby showing it to smart people, to explore our di\\x00erences if and when we have\\nthem, to evolve my thinking some more, and do that over and over again until I\\ndie. While this study re\\x00ects nearly 40 years of doing just that with China, it is\\nstill incomplete; it is right and wrong in ways that have yet to be discovered, and\\nit is provided to you to use or criticize in the spirit of \\x00nding out what’s true.\\nThis chapter is focused on China and Chinese history; the following\\nchapter is on US-China relations. What I hope to provide in this chapter is a\\nbetter understanding of where the Chinese are coming from—of how they see\\nus and themselves as a result of having lived through their history. While I’m not\\na scholar of Chinese culture and the Chinese way of operating, I believe that my\\nnumerous direct encounters with China, my historical and economic research,and my US and global perspective give me a unique sense of its past and present.\\nAfter you read this, you can decide for yourself whether or not that’s true.\\nChina’s culture, by which I mean its people’s innate expectations\\nabout how families and communities should behave with each other and\\nhow leaders should lead and followers should follow, evolved over\\nthousands of years through the rises and falls of its many ruling\\ndynasties and the development of Confucian and Neo-Confucian\\nphilosophy as well as other beliefs. I have seen these typical Chinese\\nvalues and ways of operating manifested over and over again; for example,\\nin the economic and leadership approaches of two men: Lee Kuan Yew, the\\nformer long-time prime minister of Singapore, and Deng Xiaoping, who\\ninitiated China’s reform and opening up. Both combined Confucian values with\\ncapitalist practices, in Deng’s case creating a “socialist market economy with\\nChinese characteristics.”\\nOver the last couple of years, as part of my study of the rises and\\ndeclines of empires and their currencies, I have also undertaken a study\\nof Chinese history to help me understand how the Chinese think—\\nespecially their leaders, who are greatly in\\x00uenced by history. I began my\\nresearch with the year 600, just before the Tang Dynasty.1 While I can be\\npretty certain about my impressions of the people and things that I have had\\ndirect contact with, I of course can’t be as certain about those I haven’t. My\\nthoughts about historical \\x00gures such as Mao Zedong are based on facts\\ngathered, experts’ thinking gathered from conversations and books, and\\nconjecture. What I can say is that between my own experience, the e\\x00orts of my\\nresearch team, and my extensive triangulation with some of the most\\nknowledgeable China scholars and practitioners on the planet, I have a high\\ndegree of con\\x00dence in my conclusions.\\nSince my \\x00rst trip to China in 1984, I have come to know many Chinese,\\nfrom the lowest to the highest in rank, in an up-close, personal way, and I have\\nexperienced their recent history as directly as I have experienced America’s. As a\\nresult, I believe that I understand both the American and Chinese perspectives\\npretty well. I urge those of you who haven’t spent considerable time in China to\\nlook past the caricatured pictures that are often painted by biased parties and ridyourself of any stereotypes you might have that are based on what you thought\\nyou knew about the old “communist China”—because they’re wrong.\\nTriangulate whatever you are hearing or reading with people who have spent a\\nlot of time in China working with the Chinese people. As an aside, I think the\\nwidespread media distortions and the blind and near-violent loyalties that stand\\nin the way of the thoughtful exploration of our di\\x00erent perspectives are a\\nfrightening sign of our times.\\nTo be clear, I’m not ideological. I don’t choose a side on an issue based on\\nwhether it aligns with American, Chinese, or my own personal beliefs. I’m\\npractical; I approach things like a doctor who relies on logic and cause/e\\x00ect\\nrelationships and believes in what works well through time. The only thing I can\\ndo is beg for your patience and open-mindedness as I share what I’ve learned\\nwith you.\\nI laid out the factors that I believe are most important to a country’s health\\nwhen I discussed the 18 determinants at the beginning of this book. Of those, I\\nhighlighted eight measures of power: education, competitiveness,\\ninnovation/technology, trade, economic output, military, \\x00nancial center status,\\nand reserve currency status. When I judge China’s strengths and weaknesses, it is\\nthrough the lens of those factors. I also try to understand China’s circumstances\\nas the Chinese themselves do, through their eyes.\\nTo refresh your memory, this chart shows the relative standing of the\\nworld’s leading countries as measured in indices that measure eight\\ndi\\x00erent types of power. In examining the rises and declines of the great\\nempires since 1500, I looked at each of these measures. I will now do the same\\nfor China, brie\\x00y conveying the long arc of its history while diving into its\\nhighlights in a more granular way.Breaking this rise down further, the following chart shows the eight\\nmeasures of power for China between 1800 and the present.\\nUnlike the cycles for the Dutch, British, and American empires, which\\nbegan with their rises and were followed by their protracted declines,\\nChina’s cycle over the past 200 years was a long decline followed by arapid rise. Though the order is reversed, the same forces drove the cycle.\\nSeven of the eight powers hit their lowest points in the 1940–50 period.\\nSince then, most of them—notably, economic competitiveness, education,\\nand military power—improved gradually until around 1980, when\\nChina’s economic competitiveness and trade took o\\x00. That was right\\nafter Deng Xiaoping’s open-door and reform policies began. That is no\\ncoincidence. From my \\x00rst visit to China in 1984 until about 2008, debt\\ngrowth was in line with economic growth, which was very strong. In\\nother words, extremely rapid improvements were made without loading the\\neconomy up with debt. Then the 2008 \\x00nancial crisis came along and China,\\nlike the rest of the world, used a lot of debt to stimulate its economy, so debts\\nrose relative to incomes. When Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he improved\\nChina’s debt and economic management dramatically, continued growth in\\ninnovation and technologies, strengthened education and the military, and\\nencountered greater con\\x00ict with the US. China is now roughly tied with\\nthe US in being the leading power in trade, economic output, and\\ninnovation and technology, and it is a strong and quickly rising military\\nand educational power. It is an emerging power in the \\x00nancial sector\\nbut is lagging as a reserve currency and \\x00nancial center. We will explore\\nall of this in more detail later in the chapter, but in order to understand\\nChina’s present we \\x00rst need to wade into its tremendous history.\\nCHINA’S GIANT HISTORY IN A TINY NUTSHELL\\nAnyone who wants to have a fundamental understanding of China needs to\\nknow the basics of its history, the many patterns that repeat within it, and the\\ntimeless and universal principles that its leaders have gained from studying those\\npatterns. Getting even a basic understanding of Chinese history is a considerable\\nundertaking. Spanning some 4,000 years, it is so vast and complicated, and has\\ninspired so many di\\x00erent and sometimes contradictory interpretations, that I\\nam con\\x00dent that there is no single source of truth—and I am especiallycon\\x00dent that I’m not it. Still, there is a lot that knowledgeable people agree on,\\nand many scholars and practitioners, both Chinese and non-Chinese, have\\nshared valuable insights with me. Trying to piece together all that I have learned\\nhas not only been a valuable experience for me but also a fascinating one. While I\\ncan’t guarantee that my perspectives are the best, I can guarantee that they have\\nbeen well-triangulated with some of the most informed people in the world.\\nChina’s civilization began around 2000 BCE with the Xia Dynasty, which\\nlasted about 400 years and is credited with bringing the Bronze Age to Asia.\\nConfucius, who developed the philosophy that most in\\x00uences how the\\nChinese behave with each other to this day, lived from 551 to 479 BCE. The Qin\\nDynasty united most of the geographic area that we now call China around 221\\nBCE and was followed by the 400-year Han Dynasty, which pioneered\\ngovernance systems that are still in use. The Tang Dynasty came to the fore in\\n618 CE.\\nThis chart applies to China the same overall power gauge that I\\nshowed you in the chart of great empires, covering the more than 1,400\\nyears between 600 and today. With the notable exception of the period\\nfrom around 1840 to 1950, when it experienced a steep decline, China\\nhas historically stood among the most powerful empires in the world. As\\nit emerged from civil war, it began to rise again, at \\x00rst slowly and then\\nvery rapidly. Today it is second only to the US and is poised to surpass it.\\nMost of the dynasties that ruled China over the course of this time span were\\nas cultured as they were powerful. (I only name the most prominent in the chart;\\nthere were many others.) Each of these dynasties has its own fascinating story,but to do those stories justice would take far more space than can \\x00t in this\\nchapter.\\nThe Tang Dynasty (618–907) is considered by many Chinese to be a\\nhigh point of Imperial China. The Tang came to power after a\\nprolonged period of disunion and civil war, which had culminated in\\nChina being reuni\\x00ed by the short-lived Sui Dynasty, which immediately\\npreceded the Tang. The dynasty was established by a father-son pair of\\nstrong leaders—with the son, the Tang’s second Emperor Taizong, being\\nespecially notable. They not only militarily uni\\x00ed China, but also\\nestablished a stable government system and policies that were highly\\ne\\x00ective, producing quality education, excellent development of\\ntechnologies, international trade, and diverse ideas. Taizong was a great\\nrevolutionary leader who was able to consolidate power, build a great\\ndynasty, and transition well so that the dynasty remained strong without\\nhim. A period of great prosperity lasted about 150 years, with a particularly\\nstrong military that helped the Tang control valuable trade routes in\\nCentral Asia. By the late 700s, however, the Tang slipped into decline for\\nthe classic reasons: the quality of governance fell, fragmentation over\\neconomic and values gaps led to a weakened and corrupt central\\ngovernment (which, combined with internal con\\x00ict, led to a series of\\nrebellions), its \\x00nances deteriorated, and natural disasters increased in\\nimpact.\\nThen came the Northern and Southern Song dynasties (960–1279),\\nduring which China was the most innovative and dynamic economy\\nin the world. The deterioration of the Tang Dynasty led to its own period\\nof civil war and disunion in the 900s. Out of this con\\x00ict the Song Dynasty\\ncame to power under the rule of Emperor Taizu in 960. Taizu was one of\\nthose classic strong revolutionary leaders who needed to and could bring\\norder to chaos. He successfully rose to power as a military leader and, when\\nin power, implemented widespread reforms to a) bring together the\\ndi\\x00erent factions that had previously fought for power, b) create a\\ncentralized, top-down system of military and civilian governance, and c)expand education and the quality of governance (particularly through\\nreforming the imperial examination system). These investments in\\neducation and meritocracy under Taizu and his successors set the Song\\nDynasty on the classic good path that led to immense scienti\\x00c and\\ntechnological advancement.2 However, after a few generations, around the\\nyear 1100, the dynasty declined due to a combination of weak leadership,\\n\\x00nancial problems, and other classic factors. In its weakened state, it\\nbecame vulnerable to external powers. During the 1100s and 1200s, the\\nSong \\x00rst lost control of the northern half of China, then, after a revival\\nperiod known as the Southern Song Dynasty, were conquered by Mongol\\nleader Kublai Khan.\\nKublai Khan founded the comparatively short-lived Yuan Dynasty\\n(1279–1368). For much of his rule, Kublai Khan governed well and\\nbehaved like a classic dynastic founder: he encouraged education, uni\\x00ed\\nthe state, and, relative to many other Mongol leaders, stood out for his\\nmeritocratic and open-minded style of governing. Under Kublai Khan,\\nChina’s economy and trade strengthened after a long period of con\\x00ict. At\\nthe same time, the Yuan pursued expensive wars of conquest. Corruption\\ngrew later in his rule, and the failure to establish a stable succession\\nstructure led to frequent civil wars and crises after his death. This\\ncorruption and instability helped produce rebellions that ended the\\ndynasty after less than a century.\\nThe Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) presided over an empire that was\\nlargely prosperous and peaceful. It was founded by the Hongwu\\nEmperor, who was born into poverty and rose to be a great general\\nwho captured Beijing and threw out the Mongol rulers. He\\nconsolidated power in a 14-year purge that led to about 30,000\\nexecutions. After winning power through a successful rebellion against\\nthe unpopular Yuan Dynasty, early Ming leaders built a meritocratic\\nsociety with excellent education and civil behavior that fostered\\ninnovation. Over time the Ming Dynasty expanded trade with Europe (as\\nChinese goods were of superior quality), which brought in enormous\\namounts of silver and redirected the nation’s energies from subsistenceagriculture to industry. However, the Ming’s failure to manage monetary\\nand \\x00scal policy well, to consistently support China’s in\\x00uence over\\ninternational trade, and to adequately respond to a series of crises left\\nChina exposed and vulnerable. To make matters worse, the Little Ice Age\\nled to agricultural disaster and famine. In the end, war, famine, and\\necological disaster—combined with a rigid and ine\\x00ectual state—created\\nan unrecoverable catastrophe that led to the collapse of the nearly three-\\ncenturies-old Ming Dynasty by 1644.\\nThe Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) came to power when the\\nneighboring Manchu people capitalized on instability and rebellions\\nin Ming China to challenge it. This culminated in the sacking of Beijing\\nby rebels during which the last Ming emperor committed suicide. Then\\nthe cycle began again under the Qing Dynasty. China achieved its\\nmaximum territorial expansion, governing over a third of the\\nworld’s population while reforms under the reigns of three long-\\nruling emperors led to an extended period of economic prosperity.3\\nThen the European powers arrived. Earlier in this book we saw how the\\nEuropean powers, in the Age of Exploration, used their military strength to\\ntrade with and exploit resource-rich but militarily weaker foreigners. That’s\\nwhat happened starting in the early 1800s, which began what is called the\\nCentury of Humiliation in China. The Europeans came o\\x00ering to trade\\nbut the Chinese didn’t want anything they had to o\\x00er. This led to the\\nBritish bringing opium into China to get the Chinese addicted, so that\\nthey would trade for it. A series of military confrontations followed during\\nthe 1800s (most notably the Opium Wars), which sped China’s decline.\\nChinese moves to stem their decline failed and there was great internal\\ncon\\x00ict and uprisings (most notably the Taiping Rebellion), which\\ncontinued until the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1912.\\nThe lessons this history provides remain very much in the forefront of the\\nminds of China’s current leaders and are fascinating to me, especially in the\\ncontext of the patterns of history.How the T ypical Dynastic Cy cle T ranspir es\\nThe typical major Chinese dynasty, like the typical empire, lasted about 250\\nyears, give or take 150 years, and by and large followed the same pattern of rises\\nand declines.4 You can especially see the internal order cycle, described in\\nChapter 5, at play time and time again. As a reminder of that cycle:\\nStage 1, when the new order begins and the new leadership\\nconsolidates power, which leads to…\\n… Stage 2, when the resource-allocation systems and government\\nbureaucracies are built and re\\x00ned, which if done well leads to…\\n… Stage 3, when there is peace and prosperity, which leads to…\\n… Stage 4, when there are great excesses in spending and debt and\\nthe widening of wealth and political gaps, which leads to…\\n… Stage 5, when there are very bad \\x00nancial conditions and intense\\ncon\\x00ict, which leads to…\\n… Stage 6, when there are civil wars/revolutions, which leads to…\\n… Stage 1, which leads to Stage 2, etc., with the whole cycle happening over\\nagain.\\nLet’s review this cycle quickly. The typical cycle begins with strong\\nleaders who win control and implement improvements needed to build a\\ngreat empire. As with most other empires, the initial winning of the war for\\ncontrol is typically followed by struggling to get most of the population in\\nline and united (often through con\\x00ict to establish the leadership’s power).\\nThat is typically followed by a peace that is due to no entities wanting to\\nchallenge the dominant power (Stage 1).\\nThen the new ruler turns to building up the empire. To be successful an\\nempire needs a smart and determined population that works well with\\neach other. It also needs to be strong \\x00nancially. These things are obtained by\\nsystems that train and produce people who have strong education and self-\\ndiscipline. Getting the most capable people into the most important roles\\nrequires the meritocratic selection of people. In Chinese dynasties, theimperial exams often played that role, and it was common for new\\ndynasties to implement educational reforms. It also requires an e\\x00ective\\nresource-allocation system (Stage 2).\\nDuring that period of peace and rising power, the empire typically works well\\neconomically and improves its \\x00nancial condition. While the empire typically\\nstarts with limited \\x00nancial resources and low debts because the previous\\nempire’s debts have been wiped out, in some cases it has assets that were\\nacquired as an outcome of the prior war that it won. In the case of Chinese\\nhistory, key variables were the distribution of land ownership and taxation of it\\n—often the arrival of a new dynasty weakened or overturned the “corrupt elites”\\nof the prior system, vastly improving the resources available to the state. With\\nthese resources, the dynasty pro\\x00ts and expands. It builds commercial,\\ntechnological, and military strengths that reinforce each other. For example,\\nhaving strong technologies helps the dynasty economically and militarily because\\nthey can be used for both purposes and because being strong militarily protects\\nthe country’s commercial interests (e.g., protects trade routes), which also\\nstrengthens the dynasty \\x00nancially. At its peak, the dynasty’s government is\\nfunctioning well, its resources and people are employed productively, and prior\\ninvestments are yielding new gains. The economy is strong and self-sustaining,\\nand the people are prosperous and produce great achievements in scholarship,\\nthe arts, trade, architecture, and other elements of great civilizations (Stage 3).\\nThe decline of the empire typically happens because the forces that\\nstrengthened it fade and a rival power emerges. Leadership weakens, often\\nbecomes corrupt, and/or allows corruption in others.5 Also, the dynasty\\ntypically becomes overextended and quite often becomes heavily indebted,\\nwhich causes it to have debt problems that are typically dealt with by printing\\nlots of money, which in turn devalues the money. The dynasty’s population also\\nbecomes increasingly fragmented and loses its unity of purpose and ability to\\nwork well together. The wealth gap increases, which undermines productivity\\nand leads to political con\\x00ict. Often there is some form of natural disaster,\\nfrequently a drought or a \\x00ood that exacerbates the dynasty’s problems. The\\nmore of these that happen at the same time, the greater the chance that the\\ndynasty will fall.The fall itself comes with escalating rebellions and then a bloody civil war\\n(Stage 5 and Stage 6). Eventually a strong new leader emerges, wins the con\\x00ict,\\nand begins the cycle again with a new dynasty (Stage 1 again).\\nThere are common themes in the decline of the di\\x00erent dynasties—\\nthemes also visible in the decline of some of the other powers mentioned\\nin this book:\\n1. Growing inequality and \\x00scal problems over the course of the\\ndynasty are critical drivers of the decline. Dynasties often started with\\nmore equal land and wealth holdings, as the concentrated holdings of the\\nold dynasty’s elites were redistributed—which helped with preventing\\nsocial con\\x00ict and helped the \\x00scal position (because elites often were more\\nable to shelter themselves from taxes than the broader base of small\\nlandholders). But over the years, land became concentrated in fewer and\\nfewer families, who could evade taxes (via bribery, using o\\x00cial in\\x00uence,\\nand \\x00nding other ways to hide/shelter their wealth from taxation)—which\\nin turn allowed them to build their wealth further. The inequality this\\nproduced helped directly spawn con\\x00ict, and the weakening tax base of the\\nstate made the state weaker and more vulnerable to crisis.\\n2. Monetary problems were common contributors to the decline of the\\nempires. In the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, the government\\nstruggled to maintain a large enough money supply in metal coins and\\nresorted to money printing, especially in times of war and natural or\\nhuman-caused disaster. The problems with collecting taxes made the\\nincentive to print even stronger. This caused high in\\x00ation or\\nhyperin\\x00ation, making matters worse.\\n3. The quality of governance and infrastructure tended to rise early in\\neach dynasty and then fall over the course of the dynasty. Later in the\\nSong, Ming, and Qing dynasties, years of underinvestment in public works\\nbuilt up, leaving China vulnerable to famines and \\x00oods. And while it’s\\nhard to generalize over dozens of emperors, the visionary founder of the\\ndynasty (e.g., the founders of the Song and Yuan dynasties who embraced\\ntechnology and science) was typically succeeded by rulers who were morerigid and conservative (e.g., in the Qing Dynasty), too focused on imperial\\nriches and luxuries (e.g., the last rulers of the Northern Song Dynasty),\\nand/or less supportive of foreign trade (in the Ming Dynasty).\\n4. Internal con\\x00ict usually arose from economic di\\x00erences combined\\nwith bad times (most typically caused by agricultural problems, high\\ndebts, poor governance, and natural disasters, and sometimes by\\ncon\\x00icts with outside forces). Signi\\x00cant natural disasters and periods of\\nquick climate change that were painfully disruptive often coincided with\\nthe fall of dynasties. The classic downward spiral has been that 1)\\ninadequate technology and investment (both new projects and\\nmaintenance) leaves infrastructure susceptible to natural disasters; 2) a\\ndisaster hits (in China’s case this was typically via droughts and \\x00ooding\\nfrom the major rivers), which damages crop yields and, in some cases,\\ndestroys communities, as lower crop yields lead to food scarcity and famine;\\nand 3) domestic populist uprisings result from the disasters. This process\\nplayed a signi\\x00cant role in the declines of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing\\ndynasties.\\n5. Bad conditions and large wealth gaps led to the most signi\\x00cant\\nuprisings, which were due to the common man rebelling against the\\nexcesses of the elite (e.g., the Fang La Rebellion in the Song Dynasty, the\\nRed Turban Rebellion in the Yuan Dynasty, and the White Lotus\\nRebellion in the Qing Dynasty). Conversely, domestic stability arising\\nfrom good conditions for most people was a key characteristic of the more\\nprosperous periods.\\n6. Isolation and Confucian cultural in\\x00uences that favored scholarship\\nover commerce, technology, and military strength led to China’s\\nweaker competitiveness in business, technology, and the military,\\nwhich led it to be beaten by or fall behind stronger “barbarians”—\\ne.g., the Mongols, the foreign powers in the Opium Wars, and the\\nrest of the world in the Mao isolation period.\\nChina’s physical geography and geology have also had a big impact on\\nthe rise and fall of dynasties. The main thing to know is that China’s terrainis varied and often volatile. For example, the north is colder, \\x00atter, and drier,\\nand the south is more mountainous, much warmer, and wetter, which leads to\\nChina’s di\\x00erent areas having often inconsistent crop production. However, a\\nunited China is largely self-contained because the diversi\\x00cation and\\ncoordination of the parts make it that way. Still, these conditions plus shortages\\nof clean water, cropland, and coastal marine \\x00sheries have historically made\\nChina vulnerable to food shortages. For that reason, China has often been\\nfood-insecure and even today imports a lot of food. China also has shortages\\nof important natural resources, such as oil, some minerals, and some\\nfoodstu\\x00s. It also has bad air pollution that adversely a\\x00ects the health of\\nits people and its agriculture, though it is quickly improving these\\nconditions.\\nSuch events led past and current leaders of China to learn lessons and\\nestablish protections against these natural and political disasters being\\nrepeated or leading to unacceptable consequences. In other words, there are\\nmany lessons embedded in these histories, and—believe me—all of them\\nin\\x00uence the decision making of China’s leaders today, whether they are\\nplanning for the long term or dealing with cases at hand.\\nWhat is especially interesting to me is seeing how far back in history the\\npatterns of the archetypical Big Cycle go, since China’s history is both so ancient\\nand so well-documented. I was also fascinated to see what happened when the\\nEastern and Western worlds interacted more signi\\x00cantly from the 17th through\\nthe 19th centuries, and how, as the world became much smaller and more\\ninterconnected, the Chinese and Western Big Cycles a\\x00ected each other.\\nProbably the most important thing I gained from studying the history of so\\nmany countries is the ability to see the big patterns of causes and e\\x00ects. Shifting\\nmy perspective to the very long term felt like zooming out in Google Maps\\nbecause it allowed me to see contours that I couldn’t see before and how the\\nsame stories play out over and over again for basically the same reasons. I also\\ncame to understand how having so much history to study has a\\x00ected the\\nChinese way of thinking, which is very di\\x00erent from the American way of\\nthinking, which is much more focused on what is happening now. Most\\nAmericans believe their own history is just 300 or 400 years old (since theybelieve the country began with European settlement), and they aren’t terribly\\ninterested in learning from it.\\nWhether they are interested or not, 300 years seems like a very long time ago\\nto Americans, but for the Chinese, it isn’t long at all. While the prospect of a\\nrevolution or a war that will overturn the US system is unimaginable to most\\nAmericans, both seem inevitable to the Chinese because they have seen those\\nthings happen again and again and have studied the patterns that inevitably\\nprecede them. While most Americans focus on particular events, especially those\\nthat are happening now, most Chinese leaders view current events in the context\\nof larger, more evolutionary patterns.\\nAmericans are impulsive and tactical; they \\x00ght for what they want in the\\npresent. Most Chinese are strategic; they plan for how they can get what they\\nwant in the future. I have also found Chinese leaders to be much more\\nphilosophical (literally, readers of philosophy) than American leaders. For\\nexample, I had a meeting with a Chinese leader who had just met President\\nDonald Trump and had concerns about the possibility of a US-China con\\x00ict.\\nHe explained how he approached the meeting, which struck me as starkly\\ndi\\x00erent from how President Trump likely had. This leader and I have known\\neach other for many years, during which time we have talked mostly about the\\nChinese and world economies and markets. Over those years we have developed\\na friendship. He is a very skilled, wise, humble, and likable man. He explained\\nthat going into his meeting with Trump, he was concerned about the worst-case\\nscenario where tit-for-tat escalations could get out of control and lead to war. He\\nreferred to history and gave a personal story of his father to convey his\\nperspective that wars were so unimaginably harmful and the damage of the next\\nwar could be worse than the last war, which had killed more people than any\\nother. He focused on World War I as an example. He said that to calm himself\\ndown and gain equanimity he read Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant,\\nand he realized that he could only do his best and then the outcomes would take\\ntheir course. I told him about the Serenity Prayer6 and suggested meditation to\\nhim. I went home and read Critique of Pure Reason again, which I found\\nchallenging. I did, and still do, admire him and value his perspective greatly.I tell this story to share with you one Chinese leader’s perspective on the risk\\nof wars and to also give one example of the many interactions I’ve had with this\\nleader and of the many interactions I’ve had with many Chinese leaders and\\nChinese people in order to help you see them through my eyes and through their\\neyes.\\nChinese history and philosophy, most importantly\\nConfucian/Taoist/legalist/Marxist philosophies, have a much bigger\\nin\\x00uence on Chinese thinking than American history and its Judeo-\\nChristian/European philosophical roots have on American thinking. An\\nesteemed Chinese historian told me that Mao read the mammoth 20-volume\\nchronicle Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government, which covers the 16\\ndynasties and 1,400 years of Chinese history from around 400 BCE to 960 CE,\\nand the even more mammoth Twenty-Four Histories several times, as well as\\nnumerous volumes about Chinese history and the writings of non-Chinese\\nphilosophers, most importantly Marx. He also wrote and spoke philosophically,\\nwrote poetry, and practiced calligraphy. If you are interested in what Mao\\nthought or, more importantly, how he thought, I suggest you read On Practice,\\nOn Contradiction, and of course The Little Red Book, which is a compendium of\\nhis quotations on a number of subjects.7\\nThe planning horizon that Chinese leaders concern themselves with is\\nwell over a century because that’s at least how long a good dynasty lasts.\\nThey understand that the typical arc of development has di\\x00erent\\nmultidecade phases in it, which they plan for.\\nThe \\x00rst phase of the current Chinese Empire occurred under Mao when the\\nrevolution took place, control of the country was won, and power and\\ninstitutions were solidi\\x00ed. The second phase of building wealth, power, and\\ncohesiveness without threatening the leading world power (i.e., the United\\nStates) occurred under Deng and his successors up to Xi. The third phase of\\nbuilding on these accomplishments and moving China toward where it has set\\nout to be on the 100th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China in 2049—\\nwhich is to be a “modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong,\\ndemocratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious”—is occurring under Xi and\\nhis successors. Its ultimate goal is to make the Chinese economy abouttwice the size of the US’s and to have the bene\\x00ts of its growth broadly\\nshared.8 Nearer-term goals and ways to achieve them were set out in the Made\\nin China 2025 plan,9 Xi’s new China Standards Plan 2035, and the usual \\x00ve-\\nyear plans.10\\nChinese leaders don’t just try to implement their plans; they set out\\nclear metrics by which to judge their performance, and they achieve most\\nof their goals. I’m not saying that this process is perfect because it isn’t, and I’m\\nnot saying that they don’t have political and other challenges that lead to\\ndisagreements, including some brutal \\x00ghts over what should be done, because\\nthey do (in private). What I am saying is that the Chinese have much longer-\\nterm and historically based perspectives and planning horizons, which they\\nbreak down into shorter-term plans and ways of operating, and they have done\\nan excellent job of achieving what they have set out to do by following this\\napproach. Coincidentally, my own search for patterns in history and my way of\\ndealing with tactical decisions has had a similar e\\x00ect on how I see and do things\\n—e.g., I now view the last 500 years as recent history, the most relevant historical\\narcs seem about 100-plus years long, and the patterns I’ve gleaned from this\\nperspective help me anticipate how events are likely to transpire, and how I\\nshould be positioned for them over the coming weeks, months, and years.\\nCHINA’S LESSONS AND ITS WAYS OF\\nOPERATING\\nChinese culture developed as an extension of the experiences the Chinese had\\nand the lessons they learned from them over the course of millennia. These were\\nset out in philosophies about how things work and what ways work best in\\ndealing with those realities, which made clear how people should be with each\\nother, how political decision making should be done, and how economic\\nsystems should work. In the Western world, the dominant philosophies are\\nJudeo-Christian, democratic, and capitalist/socialist, and each individual pretty\\nmuch chooses from them to come up with a mix that suits them. In China, themain philosophies were Confucian, Taoist, and legalist until the early 20th\\ncentury, when Marxism and capitalism entered the mix. Emperors typically\\nchoose their own preferences, put them into practice, learn, and adapt. If the\\nmix works, the dynasty survives and prospers (in their parlance, it has the\\n“mandate of heaven”). If it doesn’t, it fails and is replaced by another. This\\nprocess has gone on from before history was recorded and will go on for as long\\nas there are people who have to decide how to do things collectively.\\nWhile I can’t do these philosophies justice in a couple of sentences, here are\\nmy attempts:\\nConfucianism seeks to bring about harmony by ensuring that\\npeople know their roles in the hierarchy and how to play them well,\\nstarting from within the family (between the husband and the wife, the\\nfather and the son, the older sibling and the younger sibling, etc.) and\\nextending up to the ruler and their subjects. Each person respects and\\nobeys those above them, who are benevolent and at the same time impose\\nstrict standards of behavior. All people are expected to be kind, honest, and\\nfair. Confucianism values harmony, broad-based education, and\\nmeritocracy.\\nLegalism favors the rapid conquest and uni\\x00cation of “everything\\nunder heaven” by an autocratic leader. It argues that the world is a kill-\\nor-be-killed jungle in which strict obedience to the emperor’s central\\ngovernment is required, without much benevolence given in return. The\\nWestern equivalent of legalism is fascism.\\nTaoism teaches that it is of paramount importance to live in\\nharmony with the laws of nature. Taoists believe that nature is\\ncomposed of opposites—yin and yang—and that harmony is achieved\\nwhen they are balanced well.\\nUntil the early 20th century, when Marxism gained favor with Mao and his\\nsuccessors, Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism were the most in\\x00uentialphilosophies, usually with some legalism thrown in. I will brie\\x00y explain\\nMarxism when we get into the 20th century.\\nAll of these Chinese systems are hierarchical and nonegalitarian. Wang\\nQishan, the vice president of China and a remarkable historian and explorer of\\ndi\\x00erent cultures, told me that the core di\\x00erence between Americans and the\\nChinese is that Americans hold the individual above all else while the Chinese\\nput the family and the collective above everything. America is run from the\\nbottom up (e.g., democracy) and optimized for the individual; China is\\nrun from the top down and optimized for the collective. The Chinese\\nword “country” consists of the two characters for “state” and “family,” he\\nexplained, so Chinese leaders seek to run their state the way they think parents\\nshould run their families, with each person knowing their place and having \\x00lial\\nrespect for those above them. As a result, the Chinese are more humble,\\nrespectful, and rules-bound, while Americans are more arrogant, egalitarian, and\\nrules-averse. I’ve observed that while the Chinese are more interested in asking\\nquestions and learning, Americans are more interested in telling you what they\\nthink.\\nAs for governance structure (i.e., who reports to whom within the hierarchy\\nof the central government and how that extends down to interactions with\\nregional and local governments), the Chinese have evolved well-developed\\napproaches over many dynasties and thousands of years; to go into them in\\ndepth would require too great a digression.\\nUnlike other great empires that have conquered and occupied other\\ncountries, it was relatively uncommon for China to occupy distant states. China\\nis basically a giant plain surrounded by big natural borders (mountains\\nand seas), with the bulk of its population spread across the plain. Most of\\nChina’s world was con\\x00ned within those borders, and most of its wars\\nwere fought for control of it, mostly among the Chinese, though\\nsometimes between foreign invaders and the Chinese.\\nTraditional Chinese military philosophy teaches that the ideal way to\\nwin a war is not by \\x00ghting but by quietly developing one’s power to the\\npoint that simply displaying it will cause an opponent to capitulate. It\\nalso calls for the extensive use of psychology to in\\x00uence opponents’behaviors.11 Still, there have been numerous violent dynastic wars inside\\nChina. The few wars that were fought outside China were for the\\npurpose of establishing China’s relative power and opening trade.\\nScholars believe that China was loathe to expand its empire because its land\\nmass was already so large and di\\x00cult to control and because they have preferred\\nto maintain a cultural purity that is best achieved through isolation.\\nTraditionally the Chinese have preferred to enter into relations with\\nempires outside their borders in a manner that is similar to what one\\nmight expect from the previously mentioned philosophies—i.e., with the\\nparties knowing their places and acting accordingly. If China was more\\npowerful, which was typically the case, the less powerful states paid “tribute”\\nwith gifts and favors and typically received guarantees of peace, recognition of\\ntheir authorities, and trading opportunities in return. These subordinate\\ncountries typically maintained their customs and experienced no interference in\\nhow their countries were run.12\\nCHINA’S MONETARY AND ECONOMIC HISTORY\\nAs for money, credit, and the economy, the history is very long and\\ncomplicated. That said, China has gone through the full range of\\nmoney/credit/economic systems and cycles that I described earlier when\\ndiscussing the big cycle of money and credit. The currency the Chinese used\\nthe most was metal (mostly copper coins, and some silver, domestically), which\\ncontinued long after China invented paper money in the 9th century, until the\\nintroduction of the yuan in the late 19th century. Silver was the main currency\\nused internationally, though gold was also sometimes used.\\nUnderstanding the di\\x00erent systems is especially important for China, as they\\nshifted frequently between them and it helped produce prosperity or ruin in\\ndi\\x00erent periods, depending on how the system was managed. China\\nexperienced several cycles of 1) transitioning from hard currency to paper backed\\nby hard currency (Type 1 to Type 2), then 2) seeing trust in the currency increaseuntil the paper currency was circulated with no backing, (Type 2 to Type 3),\\nthen 3) having the paper currency collapse due to overprinting and loss of faith,\\nleading to the return to a hard currency (Type 3 to Type 1).\\nAs I explained in Chapter 3 there are three basic types of monetary systems.\\nIn the \\x00rst, which I call a Type 1 monetary system, money has intrinsic value\\n(because the coins are made from gold, silver, and copper). In the second, which\\nI call a Type 2 monetary system, money is linked to assets that have intrinsic\\nvalue (typically in the form of paper notes that can be exchanged for gold or\\nsilver at a \\x00xed price). In a Type 3 (or \\x00at) monetary system, money is not linked\\nto anything objective. The following diagram conveys an ultra-simpli\\x00ed picture\\nof how these currency systems rotated throughout China’s history since the\\nTang Dynasty. In fact, di\\x00erent parts of China had di\\x00erent currencies and at\\ntimes used coins and ingots from other countries (e.g., Spanish silver dollars in\\nthe late 16th century). Still the diagram is broadly indicative and meant to\\nshow that China had the same range of monetary systems as the rest of\\nthe world, and they worked in essentially the same ways, most\\nimportantly, with cycles in which hard money was abandoned due to\\ndebt problems, leading to in\\x00ation, hyperin\\x00ation, and \\x00nally a return\\nto hard money.\\n13\\nAt the start of the Tang Dynasty, money primarily consisted of copper coins\\n(i.e., hard currency). But as is classic, the supply of hard currency proved to be\\nconstraining—China was growing quickly, and the supply of copper wasn’t\\nkeeping up to provide enough money. Additionally, each copper coin was of lowvalue, and so to trade, merchants had to physically carry perhaps hundreds of\\nthousands of copper coins, which was impractical. These pressures led to the\\ninvention of the earliest forms of non-hard, money-like instruments. “Flying\\ncash” started out as essentially drafts from a bank (like checks), but merchants\\nwould circulate them like money. Eventually, the Tang government started to\\nsupervise their issuance and use.14 That said, day-to-day monetary transactions\\ncontinued to be mainly in copper coinage.\\nTrue paper money (i.e., designed to be in widespread use as legal tender) came\\na bit later in Chinese history. In the early 1100s during the Song Dynasty, the\\ngovernment took over the money-making industry and created the \\x00rst\\ncommodity-backed paper money. The paper money soon was accepted and what\\nit was backed by took on a subordinate importance. Thus began an early version\\nof a \\x00at monetary system. However, similar to bonds, the paper money had a\\nmaturity date, after which it was retired.\\nThe Song Dynasty not only invented \\x00at money, they also were the \\x00rst to\\noverprint and devalue paper money. By the mid-1100s the \\x00nancial demands on\\nthe Song treasury were extremely high, due to foreign wars and domestic revolts.\\nAs is quite typical of the declines of empires, rather than increasing taxes or\\ncutting spending, which they didn’t want to do because it would have increased\\ndiscontent, they printed \\x00at currency to fund their de\\x00cits. Initially, the\\nmonetization of de\\x00cits was manageable—th e \\x00rst \\x00at currency, known as huizi\\nnotes, was issued in modest quantities starting in 1160 and traded at near face\\nvalue for more than 30 years. But the Song government soon printed more\\nfreely, more than tripling the amount of huizi in circulation. As internal and\\nexternal con\\x00icts continued to strain the imperial treasury, the money supply\\nnearly tripled again between 1209 and 1231. As a result, the market value of that\\npaper money (measured in specie coins) fell by over 90 percent between 1195\\nand the 1230s.\\nThe same patterns repeated several more times. The Yuan Dynasty, feeling\\nconstrained by metal currency, created a new paper currency (which Marco Polo\\nmarveled at), but then overprinted it, causing the currency to eventually\\ncollapse. The early Ming Dynasty, also feeling constrained by metal currency,\\ncreated paper money to provide funds to establish a new state, but thenoverprinted it, eventually causing the currency to collapse. These are fascinating\\nstories I won’t delve into now.\\nFollowing the failure of \\x00at money at the start of the Ming Dynasty, China\\ngave up experimentation with paper currencies until the 20th century. Instead,\\nfrom the mid-14th century to around 1933, China had di\\x00erent types of metal\\ncoins, primarily silver. The intrinsic value of that silver constituted the\\nsigni\\x00cant majority of their value, though there was some premium placed on\\nthe coins themselves. For a major portion of that time, largely up until 1933,\\nChina didn’t mint, and the coins came \\x00rst from Spain, then Mexico, then\\nNorth America. In 1933, the Chinese chose to create their own national\\ncoinage, which began to circulate. Two years later, the Chinese government\\ndecided to replace the yuan with the fabi (which means “legal tender”), in order\\nto move from a currency they couldn’t print to one they could. The fabi in turn\\nexperienced increasingly rampant hyperin\\x00ation due to overprinting by the\\nRepublic of China government in World War II and the \\x00nal phases of the\\nChinese Civil War that followed. Following the foundation of the People’s\\nRepublic of China (PRC), the renminbi was introduced and remains in use to\\nthis day.\\nAs for China’s broader economy, it went from being primarily agricultural\\nand feudal through a variety of manufacturing incarnations, such as the Bronze\\nAge and the Iron Age, and developed various approaches to trading with\\nforeigners (most importantly through the Silk Road). This gave rise to a rich\\nmerchant class, producing cycles in which big wealth gaps developed followed by\\nuprisings in which their wealth was seized. Since China has always been an\\nintelligent and industrious society, numerous technological inventions moved its\\neconomy forward. Private entrepreneurial businesses also arose at di\\x00erent times\\nin China’s history, producing cycles in which wealth disparities grew, until\\ngovernments expropriated and redistributed wealth in countless ways. China\\nexperienced debt cycles like those described in Chapter 3 as well, which took\\nplace for the same reasons. There were stable periods within these big debt cycles\\nwhen debt growth wasn’t excessive; bubble periods when it was; crisis periods\\nwhen there wasn’t enough money to service debt; and in\\x00ationary (andsometimes hyperin\\x00ationary) periods when money was printed to alleviate the\\ndebt crises.\\nIt’s interesting to note that while the most powerful empires had global\\nreserve currencies, this has not been true for China’s most powerful dynasties.\\nThat is because:\\nIn the years prior to frequent oceanic travel, there was no such thing as a\\nglobal reserve currency (trade was limited and generally conducted in\\nprecious metals), and throughout its history, China never became such an\\nextensive empire (i.e., a “world power”) that a large portion of the world\\nwanted to transact with and hold its promissory notes as storeholds of\\nwealth. China never established a \\x00nancial center rivaling those in Europe,\\nand it was much less commercial. While China was ahead in \\x00nancial\\nmarket development in the Song Dynasty (establishing the \\x00rst stock\\ncompanies and using paper currency), by the 1600s \\x00nancial/capital market\\ndevelopments in China were far behind those in Europe. Culturally, being\\ncommercial was not held in high regard by China’s leaders so there was less\\ndevelopment of the commercial legal system and the \\x00nancial markets.\\nBecause of that lesser commercial development and its more isolationist\\npolicies, China generally fell behind Europe in terms of innovation, which\\nwe will discuss later.\\nFurther, China’s support for private commerce and \\x00nancial markets was\\ninconsistent—stronger in the Song and Tang periods and then more hostile\\nin the Ming and Qing, when global trade empires were \\x00rst being\\nestablished. As a result, the social and legal structures were less conducive\\nto capital accumulation/investment (e.g., corporate law was much less\\ndeveloped than in Europe and Chinese businesses tended to be family-\\nowned). Also, the state overall was less willing and able to invest in strategic\\nindustries or push innovation. Confucian ideology probably played a role\\nin this, as merchants/businesspeople were of lower status compared to\\nscholars, a viewpoint that strengthened as more conservative strains of\\nConfucianism gained sway in the Ming and Qing dynasties.Debt grew dramatically during the civil unrest and wars of the 1920s and\\n’30s, which led to the classic cycle in which promises to deliver money far exceed\\ncapacities to do so. This caused widespread defaults, which classically led to the\\nabandonment of the metal standard and the outlawing of metal coins and\\nprivate ownership of silver. As previously explained, currencies are used for 1)\\ndomestic transactions, which the government has a monopoly in\\ncontrolling (and hence can be carried out with \\x00at or even \\x00im\\x00am\\ncurrencies) and 2) international transactions, in which case the\\ncurrencies must be of real value or they won’t be accepted. The test of the\\nreal value of a currency is whether it is actively used and traded at the\\nsame exchange rate internationally as domestically. When there are\\ncapital controls that prevent the free exchange of a domestic currency\\ninternationally, that currency is more susceptible to being devalued. By\\nde\\x00nition reserve currencies have no such controls. So, as a principle: \\nwhen you see capital contr ols being put on a currency , especially when there is a big\\ndomestic debt pr oblem, run fr om that curr ency .\\nChina had two currencies in the 1930s—a \\x00at paper one for domestic\\ntransactions, and a gold one for international payments. The \\x00at paper one was\\nprinted abundantly and frequently devalued. After the turbulence of World War\\nII and the Chinese Civil War, in December 1948, the \\x00rst renminbi was issued as\\na \\x00at currency and it was kept in limited supply to end the hyperin\\x00ation. In\\n1955, a second issuance of renminbi was made, and in 1962 a third. From 1955\\nto 1971 the exchange rate was \\x00xed at 2.46 to the US dollar. Then there was\\nanother round of high in\\x00ation in the 1970s and ’80s, which was caused by the\\nglobal devaluation of money against gold in 1971, global in\\x00ationary pressures,\\nChina phasing out its price controls, easy credit, and a lack of spending controls\\namong state-owned enterprises. In 2005, the peg to the dollar was ended.\\nThe next chart shows Chinese in\\x00ation rates going back to 1750, including\\nthe periods of hyperin\\x00ation. The era of relatively stable in\\x00ation early on was\\nlargely the result of China using metals (silver and copper) as money, which were\\nvalued by weight. When the Qing Dynasty broke down, provinces declared\\nindependence and issued their own silver and copper coins, which were alsovalued by their weights. This is why there were not exceptionally high levels of\\nin\\x00ation, even during this terrible period.\\nThe following charts show the value of Chinese currency in dollar and gold\\nterms since 1920, plus the in\\x00ation and growth rates over that period. As you\\ncan see, there were two major periods of devaluation: the \\x00rst when the new\\nexchange rate was set up in 1948, and between 1980 and the 1990s when there\\nwas a series of devaluations aimed to support exporters and manage current\\naccount de\\x00cits,15 which caused very high in\\x00ation. As shown, growth was\\nrelatively fast and erratic until around 1978, then fast and much less erratic until\\nthe recent brief plunge due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWhile most Chinese have a strong desire to save and an appropriate sense of\\nrisk that innately drives them to store their wealth in safe liquid assets (e.g., cash\\ndeposits) and tangible assets (e.g., real estate and some gold), some investors have\\nlimited experiences with riskier assets such as equities and risky debt and so can\\nbe naïve, though they are learning very fast. But when it comes to Chinese policy\\nmakers’ understanding of money, credit, monetary policy, \\x00scal policy, and how\\nto restructure bad debts, I have found them to have the same kinds of deep and\\ntimeless perspectives that they have for the rest of their history.\\nFROM 1800 UNTIL NOW\\nI’ll begin with a brief overview of the period between 1800 and the\\nfoundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, examine the Mao\\nperiod a bit more closely, then take a deeper look at the period spanning\\nthe rise of Deng Xiaoping (from 1978 to 1997) and the advent of Xi\\nJinping (in 2012) until now. Then, in the next chapter, we will look at\\nUS-China relations.\\nThe Decline fr om 1800 until 1949\\nChina’s post-1800 decline began when a) the last Chinese royal dynasty\\n(the Qing Dynasty) became decadent and weak at the same time that b)\\nthe British and some other Western countries became strong, which led\\nBritish and other capitalist/colonialists to increasingly take control of\\nChina economically. Meanwhile, c) China’s \\x00nancial and monetary\\nsystem broke down under the burden of debts that couldn’t be paid and\\nthe printing of money that caused a collapse in its value, while d) there\\nwere massive domestic rebellions and civil wars.16 That severe Big Cycle\\ndecline, in which all the major strengths were in mutually reinforcing\\nfree falls, continued from around 1840 until 1949. The end of World War\\nII in 1945 led to the repatriation of most foreigners in China (except for Hong\\nKong and Taiwan) and a civil war to determine how the wealth and powerwould be divided—i.e., a war between the communists and the capitalists—on\\nthe Chinese mainland. This long period of decline was a classic case of the\\narchetypical Big Cycle, and it was followed by an equally classic case of a\\nBig Cycle upswing, in which a new leader wins control, consolidates\\npower, and begins building the basic structures that are passed on to\\nsucceeding generations, who build on each other’s accomplishments.\\nAs discussed in previous chapters, the early 1800s was the time of\\nBritain’s rise and expansion across the globe—which brought the rising\\nBritish Empire into greater contact with China. The British East India\\nCompany wanted tea, silk, and porcelain from China because it was extremely\\nlucrative to sell back home. However, the British didn’t have anything that the\\nChinese wanted to trade for so they had to pay for these goods in silver, which\\nwas a global money at the time. When the British began to run out of silver, they\\nsmuggled opium into China from India, which they sold for silver, which they\\nthen used to pay for Chinese goods. The Chinese fought to stop those sales,\\nwhich led to the First Opium War, in which the technologically superior\\nBritish Navy defeated the Chinese in 1839–42, leading Britain to impose\\na treaty that gave the British Hong Kong and opened up a number of\\nChinese ports, most notably Shanghai, to traders from Britain (as well as\\nother powers in subsequent treaties), which eventually led to the loss of\\nlarge parts of northern China to Russia and Japan and the loss of what\\nwe now call Taiwan to Japan.\\nThe Qing government borrowed heavily from foreigners to \\x00ght internal\\nrebellions. Reparations, especially after the Boxer Rebellion (a Chinese rebellion\\nagainst foreigners in 1901), also created huge liabilities. When the rebellion\\nfailed, the victorious foreign powers demanded the equivalent of about 18,000\\ntons of silver, which was structured around a 40-year debt that was guaranteed\\nby the tari\\x00 income on the ports they controlled. The Qing government, starved\\nof \\x00nancial resources, faced many uprisings over the couple decades following\\nthe Opium Wars and spent down their savings to \\x00nance \\x00ghting them. The\\ncombination of 1) not having strong leadership, 2) not having sound\\n\\x00nances, 3) having internal rebellions that undermined productivity and\\nwere costly in money and lives, 4) \\x00ghting foreigners, which was costly\\x00nancially and in lives, and 5) experiencing some big disruptive acts of\\nnature produced the mutually and self-reinforcing decline known as the\\nCentury of Humiliation.\\nIt is easy to see the important role that period has played in shaping\\nChinese leaders’ perspectives—e.g., why Mao saw capitalism as a system\\nin which companies pursued pro\\x00ts through imperialism (i.e., through\\nthe control and exploitation of countries, just as the British and other\\ncapitalist powers did to China), enriching the greedy elites while\\nexploiting workers. Mao’s view of capitalism di\\x00ers from my own because his\\nexperience with it was so di\\x00erent, though both of our views of it are true.\\nCapitalism has provided me and most others I know, including immigrants from\\nall over the world, with enormous opportunities. The America I came of age in\\nwas the land of opportunity, in which one could learn, contribute, and be\\nrewarded fairly and without boundaries. This experience of seeing through\\nanother’s eyes was another reminder for me of how important radical open-\\nmindedness and thoughtful disagreement are to \\x00nding out what is true. It led\\nme to study Marxism a bit, so I could understand why it made sense to Mao and\\nothers as a philosophy. My inclination up until then was to think of it as at best\\nimpractical and at worst a potentially evil threat, yet I was ignorant about what\\nMarx had actually said.\\nEnter Marxism-Leninism\\nBefore I examined it for myself, I’d assumed that Marxism-Leninism was a\\ndysfunctional system in which resources were theoretically distributed “from\\neach according to his abilities, to each according his needs” that failed to produce\\nmuch because of its lack of incentives to be inventive and e\\x00cient. I didn’t\\nappreciate that Marx was a brilliant man who came up with some good theories\\nand some seemingly bad ones that he would probably agree were not adequately\\ntested and re\\x00ned by the evolutionary system he espoused. Now I wonder how\\nMarx, a very practical man who believed that philosophies should only be judged\\nby the successes and failures they produce, would have diagnosed communism’s\\nnear total and universal failure and changed his thinking as a result.Marx’s most important theory/system is called “dialectical\\nmaterialism.” “Dialectical” refers to how opposites interact to produce change,\\nand “materialism” means that everything has a material (i.e., physical) existence\\nthat interacts with other things in a mechanical way. In a nutshell, dialectical\\nmaterialism is a system for producing change by observing and\\nin\\x00uencing the “contradictions” of “opposites” that produce “struggles”\\nthat, when resolved, produce progress. Marx meant it to apply to\\neverything. The con\\x00ict and struggle between the classes that is manifest\\nin the con\\x00ict between capitalism and communism is just one of many\\nsuch examples.\\nMuch of that sounds right to me.\\nThough I’m no expert on Marxism, the process of dialectical materialism is\\nsimilar to the process that I discovered for myself and explained in my book\\nPrinciples: Life and Work, in which I struggle with con\\x00icts, re\\x00ect on them,\\nwrite down the principles I derive from them, and then improve them—and do\\nthat over and over again, in a never-ending, evolutionary way that I describe as\\n“looping.” In other words, I believe, and it sounds like Marx believed, that\\nlearning and evolving from con\\x00icts and mistakes is the best approach.\\nIt is also my opinion that capitalism—an incentive system that rewards the\\npeople who are most inventive and productive, and that has capital markets that\\nreward good capital allocation decisions and penalizes bad ones—w ill lead to a)\\nmore productivity over the long run (and hence a bigger total pie), b) big wealth\\ndi\\x00erences, and c) capital markets (especially debt markets) that become\\noverextended and then break down. When there is a capital market/economic\\nbreakdown at the same time that there are big wealth and values disparities, that\\nis likely to lead to some form of revolution. Such revolutions can end\\nharmoniously and productively, but most are preceded by great con\\x00ict and\\ndestruction. So, thus far the way Marx appeared to see things and the way I see\\nthings aren’t radically di\\x00erent, though what we would choose and what we\\nwould think should be done are probably radically di\\x00erent. If you asked me a)\\nwhether I’d rather have what capitalism has delivered or what communism\\ndelivered and b) if I think the capitalist path we have now is more logical than\\nthe communist path we have seen, I’d choose capitalism as my answer to both.On the other hand, if you asked me a) if both the capitalist and the communist\\nsystems need to be reformed to make the pie grow more e\\x00ectively and to be\\ndistributed more fairly and b) if Marx’s dialectical materialism approach to\\nevolving and my 5-Step Process to evolving are broadly similar and the best ways\\nof evolving well, I would say yes to both questions (without getting hung up on\\nhow, exactly, our two approaches are di\\x00erent). Also, as far as the wealth gap\\ngoes, I share the view that it has been a big issue throughout history that can\\nthreaten all systems. I too believe that con\\x00icts produce struggle and that\\nworking through struggle produces progress. I consider the con\\x00icts between the\\nclasses (i.e., the “haves” and the “have-nots”) to be among the main drivers of the\\nrise and decline of empires, and hence the progress of history, with those drivers\\nbeing the three big cycles—money and credit, internal order/disorder, and\\nexternal order/disorder—discussed earlier in this book.\\nAll of those cycles across the leading countries were in their\\ndecline/con\\x00ict phases between 1930 and 1945, which led to revolutions\\nand wars in China and all over the world. But as always happens, the\\nforces of decline ran their course and new domestic and world orders\\nbegan. More speci\\x00cally, the external war ended in 1945 and foreign\\nforces left most of mainland China. China’s communists and capitalists\\nthen fought an internal war that ended in 1949, which led to a new\\ndomestic order, which was communism under Mao. Put yourself in Mao’s\\nposition during the 1900–49 period. Imagine him reading what Marx\\nwrote, and think about his actions during that period and in the post-\\n1949 period. It makes sense that Mao was a Marxist and held the\\nestablished Confucian approach to harmony in disdain. Democracy as we\\nknow it doesn’t have any roots in China. Legalism, with its autocratic\\napproach, does. Capitalism, on the other hand, is growing and becoming\\nmuch more deeply rooted today.\\nLenin built on what Marx said to create a two-step process for building the\\nstate, in which there is at \\x00rst a vanguard of workers though “democratic\\ncentralism” (in which only members of the party vote), which eventually leads to\\na higher communist state in which there is common ownership of the means of\\nproduction, social and economic equality, and general prosperity. Mao likedthe Marxist-Leninist approach, in which the achievement of the\\ncommunist ideal came at the end of a very long evolutionary process.\\nDeng Xiaoping reiterated this view in an interview with “60 Minutes” in\\n1986, in which he said that the capitalism he was adopting and\\ncommunism were not incompatible. “According to Marxism,” he said,\\n“communist society is based on material abundance… Only when there is\\nmaterial abundance can the principle of a communist society—‘from each\\naccording to his ability, to each according to his needs’—be applied.\\nSocialism is the \\x00rst stage of communism…” Maybe that’s true and maybe\\nit’s not. Time will tell. To me, thus far capitalism—in China or anywhere else\\n—is winning the competition. However, there can be no question that the\\nChinese mix of communism and capitalism has produced remarkable economic\\nresults over the last 40 years.\\nIn the next section I will very brie\\x00y summarize what happened between\\n1949 and now. Then I will delve into each of its phases in greater detail.\\nThe Rise fr om 1949 until Now\\nThough it’s a bit of an oversimpli\\x00cation, we can think of China’s\\nevolution from 1949 until now as occurring in three phases:\\n1. The Mao phase, from 1949 to 1976.\\n2. The Deng and Deng’s successors phase, from 1978 to 2012 when Xi\\nJinping came to power.\\n3. The Xi Jinping phase from 2012 until now.\\nEach phase moved China along the arc of its long-term development,\\nbuilding on its earlier accomplishments. In brief, events transpired as\\nfollows:\\nFrom 1949 until he died in 1976, Mao (with his various ministers,\\nmost importantly Zhou Enlai) consolidated power; built China’s\\nfoundation of institutions, governance, and infrastructure; andruled China as a communist emperor. Isolated from the rest of the\\nworld, China followed a strict communist system in which the government\\nowned everything and maintained tight bureaucratic controls. Immediately\\nfollowing the deaths of Mao and Zhou Enlai, there was a power struggle in\\n1976–78 between the Gang of Four hardliners and the reformists. Deng\\nXiaoping and the reformists emerged victorious in 1978, leading to the\\nsecond phase.\\nDeng and his ministers ran China directly or indirectly until his\\ndeath in 1997. During this phase China moved to a more collective\\nleadership model, opened up to the outside world, introduced and\\ndeveloped market/capitalist practices, and became much stronger\\n\\x00nancially and more powerful in other ways that didn’t appear threatening\\nto the United States or to other countries. To \\x00nance what was then viewed\\nas a symbiotic relationship in which the US bought items that were\\nattractively priced from China, China lent Americans money. As a result,\\nthe US acquired US dollar-denominated debt liabilities and the Chinese\\nacquired dollar-denominated assets. After Deng’s death his successors Jiang\\nZemin and Hu Jintao (and those who led China with them) continued in\\nthe same direction so China’s wealth and power grew in fundamentally\\nsound ways that did not appear threatening to the US. In 2008, the global\\n\\x00nancial crisis came along, which led to greater tensions over wealth in the\\nUnited States and other developed countries, increased resentment at the\\n\\x00ight of manufacturing jobs to China, and increased debt-\\x00nanced growth\\nin all countries, including China.\\nXi Jinping came to power in 2012, presiding over a richer, more\\npowerful China that was becoming overly indebted, too corrupt,\\nand increasingly at odds with the United States. He accelerated\\neconomic reforms, took on the challenge of trying to contain debt growth\\nwhile aggressively reforming the economy, supported the building of\\nleading technologies, and took an increasingly global stance. He also\\nbecame more proactive in reducing China’s gaps in education and its\\nincome inequality, in protecting the environment, and in consolidating\\npolitical control. As China’s powers grew and Xi’s bold objectives (e.g., theBelt and Road Initiative and the Made in China 2025 plan) became more\\napparent, tensions with the US rose, especially after Donald Trump was\\nelected president (a populist/nationalist who campaigned on stanching the\\nUS’s loss of manufacturing jobs to China). China’s position vis-à-vis the\\nUS became one of a rapidly strengthening power challenging the dominant\\none.\\nNow let’s take a closer look.\\nPhase One: Building the F oundation (1949–1976)\\nMao and the communists won the civil war and started the People’s Republic of\\nChina in 1949 and quickly consolidated power. Mao became the de facto\\nemperor (titled “chairman of the People’s Republic of China”) and Zhou Enlai\\nhis prime minister (titled “premier”). Domestically, the new government quickly\\nrepaired transportation and communications infrastructure and nationalized the\\nbanking system under the aegis of the new central bank, the People’s Bank of\\nChina. To bring down in\\x00ation it tightened credit and stabilized the value of the\\ncurrency. The government also nationalized most businesses and redistributed\\nagricultural land from large landowners to the peasants who farmed the land.\\nWhether one worked or not, one received basic pay. There was no merit-based\\npay. The protections that these guaranteed basic incomes and bene\\x00ts provided\\neveryone were collectively called “the iron rice bowl.” These changes created a\\nstable economy but little motivation.\\nInternationally, China was isolationist, though it wasn’t long before the new\\ngovernment found itself in a war. As explained in the last chapter, in 1945 the\\nnew world order divided the world into two main ideological camps—the\\ndemocratic capitalists led by the United States and the autocratic communists\\nled by the Soviet Union—with a third group of countries that were not\\ncommitted to either side. Many of these nonaligned countries had until recently\\nbeen colonies, most notably under the declining British Empire. China was\\nclearly in the Soviet-led camp. On February 14, 1950, Mao and Stalin signed theTreaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance to cooperate and come to\\neach other’s aid militarily.\\nAt the end of World War II, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel, with the\\nRussians controlling the north and the Americans the south. In June 1950,\\nNorth Korea invaded South Korea. The Chinese stayed out of the \\x00ghting\\ninitially, as they were preoccupied with their own challenges and didn’t want to\\nbe drawn into a war. In conjunction with the United Nations, the United States\\nresponded by bringing its forces into the \\x00ghting, taking the war into North\\nKorea, which borders China. The Chinese viewed this as a threat, especially\\nsince US General Douglas MacArthur made it clear that he would attack China.\\nThough the Soviets and the Chinese had a pact to support each other, Stalin\\ndidn’t want to go war with the United States so he didn’t provide China with\\nthe military support it expected. Though the Chinese were ill-prepared for war\\nagainst the much greater (and nuclear-armed) American power, the Chinese\\nentered the war, pushing the American and UN troops back to the previously\\nestablished border. This was Mao’s \\x00rst great challenge, and it is considered a\\ngreat victory by the Chinese.\\nBetween the PRC’s founding in 1949 and Mao’s death in 1976, the\\nChinese economy grew rather quickly, at an average annual rate of about\\n6 percent, with an average annual in\\x00ation rate of around 1–2 percent,\\naccumulating around $4 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves. This\\nrepresented a modest improvement, but China remained poor. And there\\nwas a lot of volatility along the way. Speci\\x00cally:\\nBetween 1952 and 1957, with the help of the Soviets, industrial\\nproduction grew at 19 percent a year, national income grew at 9 percent a\\nyear, and agricultural production grew by 4 percent a year. The Chinese\\ngovernment built industrial facilities and imported lots of equipment from\\nthe Soviets. It also reformed its agricultural practices and methods by\\ncreating cooperatives to achieve economies of scale by having farmers work\\ntogether. These were highly productive years. However, after Stalin’s death\\nin 1953, Nikita Khrushchev came to power, criticized Stalin and his\\npolicies, and alienated Mao, which led to these Chinese and Soviet leadersopenly criticizing each other, which began a period of reduced Soviet\\nsupport.\\nAround 1960 the Soviet Union shifted from being an ally to being an\\nenemy and withdrew economic support.\\nFrom 1958 through 1962, due to a drought, economic mismanagement\\nfrom the top-down mandated attempt to become an industrial power\\ncalled the Great Leap Forward, and reduced Soviet economic support, the\\neconomy contracted by 25 percent and an estimated 16–40 million people\\ndied of famine. Estimates suggest that over that period industrial output\\nfell by 19 percent in aggregate, with a fall of around 36 percent from the\\n1959 peak. Historians agree that it was a terrible period, though there is\\nsome disagreement about how much it was terrible because of terrible\\nmanagement by Mao versus other causes.\\nBetween 1963 and 1966, the economy recovered and went to new highs.\\nBut then came the Cultural Revolution.\\nAs is classic in all cycles, challenges to Mao’s leadership and ideology arose.\\nSince most Chinese emperors were taken down by insiders, this risk had to be on\\nMao’s mind (and everyone else’s). So from 1966 until 1976, he fostered a\\npolitical revolution, called the Cultural Revolution, to “purify class ranks” and\\nreinforce “Mao Zedong Thought.” Mao won the political/ideological battle,\\npurging his rival Lin Biao, who died in a plane crash during a botched coup he\\nwas accused of organizing, and “Mao Zedong Thought” was written into the\\nconstitution. The cost of Mao’s triumph was appalling. The Cultural\\nRevolution curtailed education and damaged or cost countless lives (estimates\\nrange from hundreds of thousands to as many as 20 million dead) and dealt a\\nhuge blow to the Chinese economy. By the early 1970s the situation had begun\\nto stabilize under the operational leadership of Premier Zhou Enlai. In 1969,\\nthere were clashes between Chinese and Russian troops along the border.\\n1971 was a year of great change in China. The Cultural Revolution was\\nproducing turmoil and Mao’s health was declining. That contributed to Zhou\\nEnlai playing an increasing leadership role from the background, which led to\\nhim being elected “vice chairman of the Communist Party” in 1973, puttinghim in the position of appearing to be Mao’s successor. Also in 1971 China was\\nthreatened by the Soviet Union, which was militarily much more powerful and\\nshared a 2,500-mile border with China, leading to increasing border threats. In\\n1975, after the US withdrew from Vietnam, which shares a 900-mile border\\nwith southern China, Russia built an alliance with Vietnam and moved in\\ntroops and arms. Mao had a geopolitical principle to identify the main enemy,\\nneutralize the enemy’s allies, and draw them away from the enemy. Mao\\nidenti\\x00ed the Soviet Union as China’s main enemy and recognized that the\\nSoviets were in a war with the United States that hadn’t yet turned hot but\\ncould. That led him to make the strategic move of approaching the US. Henry\\nKissinger quoted Chinese o\\x00cials as saying, “The last thing the US imperialists\\nare willing to see is a victory by Soviet revisionists in a Sino-Soviet war, as this\\nwould [allow the Soviets] to build up a big empire more powerful than the\\nAmerican empire in resources and manpower.”\\nI also know that Zhou Enlai, a reformist, had wanted to build a strategic\\nrelationship with the United States for decades because a close Chinese friend of\\nmine, Ji Chaozhu, who was Zhou Enlai’s interpreter for 17 years and interpreted\\nin the \\x00rst Kissinger-Zhou Enlai talks, told me that that was the case.17 China\\nwanted to open a relationship with the United States to neutralize the Russian\\nthreat and to enhance its geopolitical and economic position. Because in 1971\\nit was especially clear that it was in the interests of China and the United\\nStates to build a relationship, they both made overtures to establish\\nrelations. In July 1971 Kissinger—and then in February 1972 President\\nRichard Nixon—went to China and in October 1971 the United Nations\\nrecognized the Mao-led communist Chinese government and gave China a seat\\non the Security Council. During Nixon’s visit, Nixon and Zhou Enlai\\nsigned an agreement—the Shanghai Communique—in which the US\\nstated that it “acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan\\nStrait maintain that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of\\nChina. The United States government does not challenge that position. It\\nrea\\x00rms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the\\nChinese themselves.” Despite those assurances, reuni\\x00cation with Taiwanstill remains the most consistently contentious issue between China and\\nthe US.\\nFollowing those moves of rapprochement, US relations with China and trade\\nand other exchanges began.\\nThen, in January and September 1976, \\x00rst Zhou Enlai and then Mao\\ndied and communist China faced its \\x00rst succession crisis. From 1976 to\\n1978, there was a \\x00ght for power between the Gang of Four (hardline\\nconservatives who fostered the Cultural Revolution) and the reformists (who\\nwanted economic modernization and an opening up to the outside world). The\\nreformists won, and Deng Xiaoping became the paramount leader in 1978.\\nPhase T wo: Deng and His Successors Gain Str engths Thr ough\\nEconomic Reforms and Opening Up Without Cr eating Thr eats t o\\nOther Countries (1978–2012)\\nDeng Xiaoping was 74, with a wealth of experience under his belt. From\\n1978 until he died in 1997 his most important policies were conveyed in\\na single phrase: reform and opening up. “Reform” meant market\\nreforms, using markets to help allocate resources and incentivize people,\\nand “opening up” meant interacting with the outside world to learn,\\nimprove, and trade. Capitalism became a part of the communist mix.\\nChina was still extremely poor—its per capita income was less than $200 a year.\\nDeng knew these moves would make China \\x00nancially stronger if they were not\\ndisrupted by the far stronger foreign powers who wanted China to remain weak;\\nthe key was to pursue them in ways that bene\\x00ted and didn’t threaten them. In\\n1979, he established full diplomatic relations with the US.\\nEarly on, Deng set out a 70-year plan to a) double incomes and ensure\\nthat the population would have enough food and clothing by the end of\\nthe 1980s, b) quadruple GDP per capita by the end of the 20th century\\n(which was achieved in 1995, \\x00ve years ahead of schedule), and c) increase\\nper capita GDP to the levels of medium-level developed countries by\\n2050 (on the 100th anniversary of the PRC). He made it clear that China\\nwould achieve those goals by having a “socialist market economy,” whichhe also referred to as “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” He made\\nthat radical shift without criticizing Marxism-Leninism; indeed, as noted earlier,\\nhe did not see the two systems as fundamentally at odds, but rather viewed them\\nthrough the lens of dialectical materialism, as opposites that could be resolved,\\nleading to progress along the long arc toward communism’s ideal state.\\nDuring his term, Deng also reformed the decision-making structure of\\ngovernment. More speci\\x00cally, he moved its decision-making process from one\\nthat was dominated by a single leader (previously Mao) to one in which the\\nPolitburo Standing Committee took votes when a consensus couldn’t be\\nreached. He also changed the system of choosing the standing members of the\\nPolitburo from one in which the supreme leader personally selected them to one\\nin which candidates—generally quali\\x00ed government o\\x00cials—were chosen via\\nconsultation and negotiation with experienced party elders. To institutionalize\\nhis governing philosophy, Deng shaped the new Chinese constitution, which\\nwas adopted in 1982. This new constitution also made a number of changes to\\nfacilitate the economic reforms and open-door policies that Deng wanted. It\\nestablished term limits for leaders (two \\x00ve-year terms) and discouraged\\nautocratic decision making by formalizing his “collective leadership/democratic\\ncentralist” policies. The new constitution also provided for greater freedom of\\nreligion, opinion, speech, and the press, to encourage the Chinese to “seek truth\\nfrom facts.” These reforms enabled the \\x00rst orderly transition of power to\\nthe next-generation Politburo Standing Committee, led by Jiang Zemin,\\nand then on to Hu Jintao, with their transitions following the prescribed\\ntwo \\x00ve-year terms. Each successive leadership team kept to Deng’s basic\\npath of making China richer and more powerful by making its economy\\nmore market-driven/capitalist and by increasing China’s trade with and\\nlearning from other countries, with those in other countries feeling more\\nexcited than threatened by their interactions and trade with China.\\nRegaining territories it lost during its Century of Humiliation was\\nalso a very important long-term goal. In 1984, after a lot of haggling with the\\nUK, it was agreed that Hong Kong would return to Chinese sovereignty in\\n1997, with a “one country, two systems” approach. Then in 1986, Chinareached an agreement with Portugal to obtain Macau’s return to Chinese\\nsovereignty in 1999.\\nIn 1984, I had my \\x00rst direct contact with China. I visited China at the\\ninvitation of the China International Trust Investment Corporation (CITIC),\\nChina’s only “window company” (which meant that it was allowed to deal freely\\nwith the outside world), whose leaders had asked me to help them understand\\nhow world \\x00nancial markets work. The company had been set up as an\\nextension of Deng’s reform and opening-up policies and was run by Rong Yiren,\\nan old Chinese capitalist who had chosen to stay in China even after his family’s\\nbusiness was nationalized.\\nChina was very poor and backward then. However, it was immediately clear\\nto me that its people were smart and civilized and its poverty was widely shared.\\nIn this regard, it wasn’t like most other undeveloped countries I’d been to, where\\nthe poor seemed to live in a di\\x00erent century. China’s backwardness stemmed\\nfrom a general lack of access to what was available in the outside world and from\\nits demotivating system. For example, I gave out $10 calculators as gifts, and even\\nthe highest-ranking people thought they were miraculous devices. At the time,\\nall businesses (including small restaurants) were government-owned and\\nbureaucratic. The Chinese couldn’t choose their jobs, never mind their careers,\\nand received no \\x00nancial incentives for working well. There was no private\\nownership of property, such as one’s home, and there was no contact with what\\nthe world had to o\\x00er in terms of best practices and products.\\nBecause it was clear to me that the closed door was the reason for China’s\\npoverty, I believed that its removal would naturally equalize its standards of\\nliving with the developed world, just as unconstrained water naturally seeks the\\nsame level. It was easy to visualize that happening. I remember being on the 10th\\n\\x00oor of CITIC’s “Chocolate Building” to give a lecture. I pointed out the\\nwindow at the two-story hutongs (poor neighborhoods) below us and told my\\naudience that it would not be long before they would be gone and skyscrapers\\nwould stand in their place. “You don’t know China,” they said in disbelief. I told\\nthem that they did not know the power of the economic arbitrages that would\\noccur as a result of opening up.While the opening up created a great natural opportunity, the Chinese made\\nthe most of it and performed even beyond my highest expectations. They did\\nthat by making and implementing Deng’s reforms, supported by uniquely\\nChinese cultural in\\x00uences. The expressed goal that I heard a lot of in those\\nearly days of reform was to “break the iron rice bowl,” which was to no longer\\nprovide demotivating guaranteed employment and ensured basic bene\\x00ts and\\nreplace them with more incentive-based compensation. Globalization also\\nhelped a lot; the world wanted to include China.\\nDeng was an eager learner and he directed his policy makers to learn from\\noutsiders in the same way that he did. He especially relied on Lee Kuan Yew of\\nSingapore and other leaders of the culturally aligned “Asian Tiger” economies\\nfor advice. I remember a dinner with the head of China’s MOFTEC (which was\\ntheir ministry of commerce), in which he rattled o\\x00 details about the operations\\nof Singapore’s airport (including how long a passenger had to wait to get their\\nbags at the baggage claim), how Singapore achieved such great results, and how\\nChina was going to implement those practices itself. Many years later I had the\\nopportunity to host Lee Kuan Yew at my house, along with some other\\nesteemed guests. We asked him to share his thoughts about leaders of the present\\nand past. We were eager to get his perspective because he had known most of\\nthem over the last 50 years and was one of the greats himself. Without hesitating,\\nhe said that Deng was the greatest leader of the 20th century. Why? Because he\\nwas smart and wise and open-minded, he was extremely practical, and he\\ndelivered great results for his country of a billion people.\\nWhile Deng formally stepped down from the Politburo’s Standing\\nCommittee in 1987, he remained the de facto leader of China, which continued\\nto open up and become more capitalist at a breakneck pace. I played a small part\\nin its evolution over the years. In 1989, my CITIC friend Wang Li (who was\\nresponsible for bond trading) introduced me to the group of people who, along\\nwith her, had been designated to create the organization that would set up the\\n\\x00rst stock markets in the new China (the Stock Exchange Executive Council,\\nknown as SEEC). They had been appointed by seven companies at the request\\nof the visionary economic reformer and historian Wang Qishan.China was still very poor, and SEEC’s o\\x00ce was in a dingy hotel because the\\ngroup lacked adequate funding. Still, they had what mattered most—a clear\\nmission to create big changes, smart people of good character, open-mindedness\\nto allow rapid learning, and determination to achieve their goals. This was not a\\njob to them; it was a noble mission to improve their country. I was thrilled to\\nhelp them. And over the decades that followed, I saw how they and many others\\nbuilt the Chinese \\x00nancial markets to become among the largest in the world.\\nThen, a shock happened that led everyone to question just about everything.\\nIn 1989, a movement to democratize China grew into the demonstrations that\\nled to the crackdown known as the Tiananmen Square incident. The leadership\\nwas split on how to handle the movement. Deng made the de\\x00ning choice,\\nwhich was to sideline the liberal forces and go ahead with the conservatives’\\ncrackdown. Most Chinese people I spoke with at the time were worried that\\nChina would slip back into its old Mao/Gang-of-Four-type ways. A very close\\nfriend from CITIC, Madame Gu, whose brother was China’s minister of\\ndefense, happened to be staying with my family at the time, so I saw events\\nunfold through her eyes as well as through the eyes of other Chinese friends.\\nMadame Gu had been an idealistic follower of Mao in the early years after\\n“liberation.” When the Cultural Revolution came along she lost her husband to\\npersecution and was shunned by friends. She got past that terrible experience to\\nwork on behalf of the country she loved and rose to a senior job at CITIC. She\\ncried at the prospect of a return to those terrible old days. Tiananmen Square\\nsigni\\x00cantly set back most countries’ relationships with China, but it didn’t\\nkeep Deng and his government from continuing their reforms. Over time, most\\nof my Chinese friends who were heartbroken about the crackdown came to\\nbelieve that the government had made the right move because their greatest fear\\nwas revolutionary disorder.\\nOver the next decade, the economy continued its strong growth, and\\nrelations and trade with the West became better than ever. Globalization, which\\nhelped China immensely, can be said to have begun in 1995 with the formation\\nof the World Trade Organization (the epoch e\\x00ectively ended with the election\\nof Donald Trump in 2016). China joined the WTO in 2001 and its position in\\nworld trade soared. That year, the United States had more trade than China with80 percent of WTO member countries. Now China is a larger trading partner\\nthan the United States for about 70 percent of those countries.\\nDuring this period of globalization, a symbiotic relationship\\ndeveloped between China and the US in which the Chinese\\nmanufactured consumer goods in an extremely cost-e\\x00ective way and\\nloaned the US money to buy them. It was a hell of a “buy now, pay later”\\ndeal for the Americans, and the Chinese liked it because they built their\\nsavings in the world’s reserve currency. It struck me as odd that the Chinese,\\nwho were earning about a 40th of Americans on average, would be lending\\nmoney to Americans, since rich people are in a better position to lend than poor\\nones. To me, it was a shocking re\\x00ection of how deeply Americans were willing\\nto get into debt to \\x00nance their overconsumption and how much more the\\nChinese valued saving. It was also a re\\x00ection of how emerging countries that\\nwant to save in the bonds/debt of the leading reserve currency countries can lead\\nthose countries to become overindebted.\\nIn 1992, China’s “triangular” debt crisis came to a head. These were debt and\\neconomic problems that arose from China’s \\x00ve major government-owned\\nbanks lending to large, ine\\x00cient, and unpro\\x00table state-owned enterprises with\\nthe implicit guarantee of the central government. Zhu Rongji, a bold reformer at\\nthe top of the party, led the e\\x00orts to restructure the economy to become more\\ne\\x00cient. This process was extremely controversial and hurt a lot of people who\\nhad bene\\x00ted from the old system, so it took a lot of courage and intelligence, as\\nwell as support from the top, to execute. Best practices (e.g., using “bad banks”\\nto take, sell o\\x00, and wind down the bad debts) were used and modi\\x00ed for the\\nChinese environment. Zhu became premier in 1998 and in that capacity\\ncontinued to aggressively pursue reforms to modernize and make the Chinese\\neconomy more e\\x00cient, until he retired in 2003. Many of his former aides are\\namong China’s senior economic policy makers today.\\nIn 1995, I sent my 11-year-old son Matt to China, where he lived with\\nMadame Gu and her husband and attended what was then a poor local\\nschool (Shi Jia Hu Tong Xiao Xue). Matt had been to China with me many\\ntimes since he was 3 years old and had gotten to know Madame Gu well. He\\ndidn’t speak the language, so he would have to learn through immersion, whichhe did. Though his school was poor (for example, there wasn’t heat until late\\nNovember, so students wore their coats in class), it had smart and caring teachers\\nwho provided the children with an excellent, complete education that included\\ncharacter development. Though Matt was deprived of some comforts he was\\nused to (he couldn’t take hot showers because the old apartment building he\\nlived in only had hot water two days a week, for example), he was superbly\\neducated, loved, and better developed than he would have been in our rich\\ncommunity. He built deep attachments with his teachers and friends that still\\nexist. The experience led him to set up a foundation to help Chinese orphans\\nthat he ran for 12 years. Around that time I also hired a Chinese team to\\ninvest American institutional money in Chinese businesses. I pursued the\\ne\\x00ort for a couple of years but had to discontinue it because I found it\\ntoo di\\x00cult to run it and Bridgewater at the same time.\\nIn 1995–96 it became widely known that Deng’s health was failing. Chinese\\nleaders worried that his death would be viewed as an opportunity to challenge\\nChinese authority. They were especially worried that the Taiwanese would hold\\na referendum in favor of independence. President Lee Teng-hui, whom China\\nregarded as a pro-independence leader, had just made a controversial visit to the\\nUS, shortly in advance of his nomination for Taiwan’s 1996 presidential\\nelection. Madame Gu knew the Chinese o\\x00cial in charge of relations with\\nTaiwan and arranged for me to meet with him. He told me that China would do\\nanything, including going to war, to prevent Taiwanese independence. Should a\\nnew Chinese leader permit a referendum, he explained, the Chinese people\\nwould regard him as too weak to lead. China had seen how Russia’s brutal\\nsuppression of rebels in the Chechen Republic had led to reduced support for\\nindependence; the Chinese hoped that a series of missile tests in the Taiwan\\nStrait would similarly dampen Taiwan’s enthusiasm. In March 1996, President\\nBill Clinton, who was facing re-election, sent two aircraft carriers into the\\nTaiwan Strait. Further military movements and threats on both sides followed.\\nAt the end of the day, the Taiwanese never held the referendum, so my Chinese\\nfriends thought their moves had been successful, while the Americans believed\\nthat they had humiliated the Chinese (which I only recently found out from an\\nAmerican friend who was involved in the decision to send in the Americanwarships). As a result of the “Third Taiwan Strait Crisis,” the Chinese\\nsigni\\x00cantly built up their military capabilities in the region. I point this out to\\nconvey a) how important Taiwan’s reuni\\x00cation with China is and b) how risky\\nthe situation was 25 years ago, when China was not nearly as strong militarily as\\nit is now. In short, I would worry a lot if we were to see a “Fourth Taiwan\\nStrait Crisis.”\\nDeng died on February 19, 1997, having transformed China almost\\nbeyond recognition. When he came to power, 90 percent of the\\npopulation lived in extreme poverty; at the time of his death that\\nnumber had fallen by more than half, and as of the most recent data is\\nbelow 1 percent. From the start of his reforms in 1978 until his death in\\n1997, the Chinese economy grew at an average rate of 10 percent a year,\\nsextupling in size while experiencing an average in\\x00ation rate of just 8\\npercent. Its reserves grew from $4 billion to nearly $150 billion (in\\x00ation-\\nadjusted to today’s dollars, its reserves grew by over $250 billion). Those reserves\\ncovered 60 percent of annual imports in 1978. By 1998, they covered more than\\n125 percent of imports (and nearly 800 percent of foreign debt service).\\nDeng’s successors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao and their teams\\ncontinued the reforms and the advances through many ups and downs\\n(though more ups than downs). In 1997, the Asian \\x00nancial crisis came along.\\nWith Zhu Rongji assigned to run the e\\x00ort, China did a very successful debt and\\ncorporate restructuring, which included sales of unpro\\x00table state-owned\\nenterprises, the building up of exports and foreign exchange reserves, a\\ncrackdown on corruption, and the further development and improvement of\\nmarkets and market functioning. These and other changes were all important\\nevolutionary steps. I felt lucky to be intimately involved at the grassroots level\\nwith some of them—e.g., the debt restructuring and asset sales. Though these\\nevents seemed bigger at the time than they appear in retrospect, they were all\\nsigni\\x00cant achievements. I also ran into cases of corruption and bad behavior,\\nand witnessed close-up the ongoing struggle between the good and the bad that\\nled to further reforms.\\nAs is typical of post-war periods of peace and prosperity, when the\\nleading power isn’t threatened and emerging countries aren’t yetthreatening, emerging countries can learn a lot from the leading powers\\nas they work together in a symbiotic way, until the emerging power\\nbecomes powerful enough to threaten the leading power. In addition to\\nbene\\x00ting from the learning, they bene\\x00t from trading with each other\\n(until that becomes disadvantageous), and they bene\\x00t from using the\\ncapital markets to their mutual bene\\x00t (until that becomes\\ndisadvantageous).\\nMore speci\\x00cally, the 1978–2008 period of fast growth in China came\\nabout because 1) the world was still in the peace and prosperity phase of\\nthe Big Cycle in which globalization and capitalism—i.e., the belief that\\ngoods and services should be produced wherever is most cost-e\\x00ective,\\nthere should be free \\x00ows of talented people without prejudice toward\\ntheir nationalities, nationalism is bad, and global equal opportunity and\\npro\\x00t-seeking capitalism are good—were understood to be the widely\\naccepted paths to a better world, while at the same time 2) Deng\\nXiaoping swung the pendulum from communist and isolationist policies\\nthat worked terribly to market/state-capitalist and open-door policies\\nthat worked terri\\x00cally. That led China to learn a lot, attract a lot of\\nforeign capital, and become a giant exporter and big saver.\\nAs the Chinese became more capable of producing cost-e\\x00ectively, they\\nprovided the world with inexpensive goods at \\x00rst and more advanced goods\\nlater, becoming much richer in the process. Other emerging countries did so as\\nwell, the world expanded, and the wealth gaps between the richest countries and\\nthe poorest countries narrowed as the poorest countries rose the most while the\\nrichest countries grew at slower rates. These circumstances lifted most boats,\\nespecially the boats of the global elites. China rose to be a nearly comparable\\npower to the United States, and together they created most of the world’s new\\nwealth and new technologies. Europe, which had been the source of the greatest\\nglobal powers from the 15th to the 20th centuries, became relatively weak, and\\nJapan and Russia became secondary powers. All other countries were peripheral.\\nWhile emerging countries like India improved their conditions, none of them\\nachieved world power status.Phase Thr ee: The Emer gence of US-China Conﬂicts and the End of\\nGlobalization (2008–Pr esent)\\nAs is classic, periods of prosperity \\x00nanced by debt growth lead to debt\\nbubbles and large wealth gaps. In the US, the bubble burst in 2008 (as it did\\nin 1929), and the world economy contracted and middle-class Americans and\\nthose in other countries were hurt (as in 1929–32). Interest rates were pushed\\ndown to 0 percent (as in 1931), which still wasn’t enough easing, so central\\nbanks printed a lot of money and bought a lot of \\x00nancial assets after 2008 (like\\nin 1934), which drove up their prices in most countries starting in 2009 (as\\nhappened in 1933–36). This bene\\x00ted the “haves” (people who had \\x00nancial\\nassets) more than the “have-nots” (those without them) so the wealth gaps grew\\nwider still (as they did in the 1933–38 period). The “have-nots,” especially those\\nwhose jobs were being taken by the Chinese and immigrants, began to rise up\\nagainst the elites who were bene\\x00ting from globalization. As is typically the case\\nwhen economic bad times coincide with large wealth gaps, populism and\\nnationalism grew around the world (as they also did in the 1930s). That is when\\nthe threat the rising powers pose becomes more apparent to the leading powers.\\nThe era of peace, prosperity, and globalization began to wane, giving way\\nto an era of con\\x00icts between the rich and the poor within countries and\\nbetween the rising country (China) and the dominant world power (the\\nUS).\\nThe Chinese were holding a lot of US dollar-denominated debt—especially\\nfrom US government agency lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For quite a\\nwhile, the US government didn’t let the Chinese holders of this debt know\\nwhether it would stand behind it. I had conversations with top Chinese holders\\nof this debt, as did David McCormick (who is now CEO of Bridgewater and\\nwas the US Treasury’s undersecretary for international a\\x00airs at the time) and\\nHank Paulson (who was the US Treasury secretary). We were all impressed with\\nthe consideration and cooperation with which the Chinese approached the\\ndilemma that the US had caused them. They were calm, empathetic, and\\ncooperative.In November 2008, leaders of the G20 countries gathered in Washington,\\nDC, and agreed to jointly stimulate their economies through aggressive \\x00scal and\\nmonetary policies. These required a substantial increase of government debt,\\nwhich was \\x00nanced by having central banks create more money and credit. Debt\\ngrowth in China was signi\\x00cantly faster than economic growth between\\n2009 and 2012 as a result of those policies.\\nBecoming a W orld P ower\\nIn 2012, Xi Jinping came to power and a new administration was chosen.\\nFollowing the well-established sequence, \\x00rst Politburo members were chosen,\\nthen ministers, vice ministers, and their senior subordinates. Then the \\x00rst\\nrounds of plans were made. As when most new leaders take power, there was a\\nlot of excitement and an eagerness to strengthen both the rule of law by purging\\ncorruption and China’s economy by strengthening and adding to its market-\\nbased reforms. There were a number of brainstorming sessions, and I was lucky\\nenough to participate in a few. They were wonderful collaborations of people\\nwith di\\x00erent perspectives who wanted to help; the frankness, open-\\nmindedness, friendliness, and intelligence that they brought to the table was\\nremarkable.\\nSince then, I have closely followed China’s \\x00nancial and economic\\ncircumstances and have had numerous conversations with its top economic\\npolicy makers about such matters as excessive debt growth, the development and\\nmanagement of their shadow banking system, the vulnerabilities in their\\n\\x00nancial systems, their trade disputes with the US, and more. I always tried to\\nsee things from their perspective and think about what I would do if I were in\\ntheir shoes. I shared what I saw with them as frankly as a doctor discussing a\\nmedical case with colleagues, in much the same way as I am sharing it with you\\nin this book.18 As you probably know by now, I believe that everything works\\nlike a machine, with timeless and universal cause/e\\x00ect relationships. Chinese\\nleaders do too, so we almost always came to similar conclusions.\\nOver the years, the Xi administration has aggressively pursued policies\\nto reform and open up its markets and its economy; manage its debtgrowth; more \\x00exibly manage its currency; support entrepreneurship\\nand market-oriented decision making, especially in industries that China\\nwants to be world leaders in; establish sensible regulations run by well-\\ndeveloped regulatory organizations; build its capabilities in the\\ntechnologies and industries of the future; broaden the economic bene\\x00ts\\nextended to the people and regions that were lagging the most; and\\ncontrol pollution and environmental degradation. Yet many people don’t\\nsee it that way, which I suspect is because a) the reforms are coming at the same\\ntime as other controls are tightening up, b) some of the supports (like credit\\navailability) for small- and medium-size organizations are not as good as they are\\nfor larger state-owned enterprises (which has more to do with technical\\nchallenges than any reduced desire to foster the development of small- and\\nmedium-size organizations), c) the government directs the economy from the\\ntop down, sometimes expecting banks and companies to make uneconomic\\nloans (because it wants to do what is best for the country as a whole), d) China\\ncoordinates with its businesses in pursuit of national goals, e) it doesn’t let some\\nforeign companies operate on the same terms as Chinese companies, and f) it\\ncoordinates \\x00scal and monetary policy to regulate the economy much more than\\nis done in the major reserve currency countries—all of which are typically\\nunpopular with capitalist outsiders.\\nCertainly many Americans are critical of these policies. While I won’t delve\\ninto the merits of them, I will say that we should expect all countries’ leaders\\nto try to get the best balance between “state” (government in\\x00uence and\\ncontrol of the economy) and “capitalism” (free-market control of the\\neconomy and capital markets) through the proper management and\\ncoordination of monetary and \\x00scal policies, and we should try to\\nunderstand the thinking behind their approaches. For example, President\\nXi has said he wants to a) reduce the government’s role in pricing and allocating\\nresources, develop the capital markets, and stimulate entrepreneurship while also\\nb) strongly directing the macro economy and regulating markets and other\\naspects of life to be what he and the party believe are best for most Chinese. In\\nother words, he wants a mix of capitalism and Marxist communism. This is\\nunderstandably confusing to those who aren’t used to seeing capitalism andcommunism go together, aren’t watching closely, and haven’t spoken with the\\npolicy makers to understand their circumstances and perspectives, so they can’t\\nsee the consistencies that exist amid the seemingly great inconsistencies\\n(i.e., “the dialectics” as Marx and the Chinese leaders would call them).\\nTo understand their circumstances and perspectives, I suggest that\\nyou not view what they are doing through stereotypes (e.g., of “what\\ncommunists do”) and accept that they are trying, and will continue to\\ntry, to juggle these two seemingly inconsistent things. In their view\\ncapitalism is a way of raising the living standards of most people and is\\nnot meant to serve capitalists. Whether one thinks this approach is good\\nor bad, their results have been extremely impressive so we should not\\nexpect the Chinese to abandon it for an American or Western approach.\\nRather, we should study it to see what we can learn from it, the same way\\nthat the Chinese have studied and learned from the West. After all, what\\nwe have is a competition of approaches that we need to understand in\\norder to play this competitive game well.\\nAs far as foreign policy is concerned, China has become stronger and\\nmore forceful while the United States has become more confrontational.\\nMore speci\\x00cally, from 2012 until the time of my writing China’s\\nstrengths have grown, which has become increasingly apparent and more\\nopenly shown (e.g., the Made in China 2025 plan trumpets its plans to\\ndominate certain industries that the United States currently controls).\\nThis has sparked a strong reaction in the US, which became most evident\\nafter the election of Donald Trump in 2016.\\nTrump tapped into the resentments of those left behind by globalization,\\nwho believed that China was unfairly competing and stealing their jobs, and\\nnurtured a new spirit of protectionism and nationalism. It wasn’t just Trump.\\nChina’s strength had become a provocation for more moderate policy\\nmakers as well. Where there had been synergy there was now raw\\ncompetition.\\nBasically China does not want to be contained and the United States\\n(and some other countries) want to contain it. What does that mean\\ngeopolitically? As you know by now, countries’ boundaries haveconstantly changed over time, they are often in dispute, and\\ninternational law isn’t worth a hill of beans relative to power in resolving\\nthese disputes. In 2009 China declared to the United Nations that it has\\n“indisputable sovereignty over” an area in the East and South China Seas.\\nThe area is marked by a “nine-dash line” on a World War II era map\\npresented by China; it covers o\\x00shore waters east of Vietnam, north of\\nMalaysia, and west of the Philippines, which include a bunch of islands,\\nare important for shipping that China needs, and are believed to have\\nundiscovered oil reserves, which I imagine China would love to have\\ngiven its huge imported oil needs and the risk of oil imports from the\\nMiddle East being cut o\\x00. If you read the World War II case study in\\nChapter 6 and saw how the US cut o\\x00 resources to Japan, you know the\\nissue: China has a great need for oil and other imports that currently\\ncome through a choke point at the Strait of Malacca.\\nAs a result of all of this and other assertions, the perception of China\\nas a threat/enemy has emerged, globalization has reversed, and “wars”\\nhave intensi\\x00ed, starting with the trade and economic wars, expanding\\nto the technology and the geopolitical wars and, most recently, to the\\ncapital war. All remain relatively mild in relation to what they could be,\\nbut they should be watched closely. Eventually the actual powers of a\\ncountry that are recognized become consistent with the actual powers\\nthat exist. The actual powers that exist are re\\x00ected in the gauges and\\nother facts that I’m watching for guidance.\\nChina has continued to grow internally and to expand its investment and\\nbusiness activities outside its borders. It has invested heavily in the\\ndeveloping world, most notably through the Belt and Road Initiative,\\nwhich extends through Central Asia, starting with the countries on its\\nborder (Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan) to Europe,\\nand through the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia into the\\nMediterranean and Africa. The amounts invested and earmarked for\\ninvestment are enormous—the largest such program since the Marshall\\nPlan. It is a good demonstration that wealth = power. While these moves\\nhave been appreciated by the countries that received the bene\\x00ts from roads andother infrastructure, resources, and trade, they have also sparked resentments\\nfrom recipient countries who are having problems paying back their loans and\\n\\x00nd that China is too controlling, and from the United States because China’s\\nassertions of soft power have lessened American in\\x00uence in those countries.\\nAs far as China’s internal politics are concerned, in 2018 Xi a)\\nconsolidated power around himself and his supporters (called “the core”\\nleadership), b) amended the Chinese constitution to make it clear that\\nthe Chinese Communist Party has control over everything, c) eliminated\\nterm limits for the president and vice president, d) created supervisory\\ncommissions to ensure that government o\\x00cials are operating\\nconsistently with the party’s wishes, and e) enshrined Xi’s perspective,\\ncalled “Xi Jinping Thought,” into the constitution. As of this writing,\\nbig political changes, increased controls, and wider distribution of\\nwealth are all underway. Some people are concerned that Xi is becoming more\\nautocratic than Mao. I’m no expert on Chinese politics so I don’t have much to\\no\\x00er when it comes to China’s internal political matters, but I will pass along\\nwhat I am told, which is that Xi’s controversial moves to tighten his control\\ncame about because of the belief that China is entering a more di\\x00cult phase in\\na more challenging world, and that at such times, unity and continuity of\\nleadership are especially important, and that will be the case even more over the\\nnext few years. As mentioned earlier, \\n during  periods of great crisis, more autocratic\\nand less democr atic leadership tends t o be pr eferred.\\nThen, in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began in China, sparking a\\nworldwide economic downturn in 2020 and the massive printing and creation\\nof money and credit, which coincided with various types of con\\x00icts in the US\\n(most obviously, protests related to racial injustice, and a very contentious\\npresidential campaign). That brings us up to today.\\nLooking back over the last four decades, China’s shift from isolation\\nto opening up and from hard-core communism to “market reforms” and\\ncapitalism have had a greater impact on the economies of China, the US,\\nand the rest of the world than anything else. China transitioned from one\\nof the most backward countries in the world to one of the two most powerful\\neconomically, technologically, militarily, and geopolitically. Most of that progressoccurred during an era of peace and prosperity, when the leading empire wasn’t\\nthreatened and globalization and cooperation \\x00ourished. The period lasted until\\nthe bursting of the debt bubble in 2008, when the United States and much of\\nthe rest of the world became more nationalistic, protectionist, and\\nconfrontational, following the archetypical Big Cycle progression.\\nThe results of China’s reform and opening up are re\\x00ected in the following\\ntable, which shows just a few representative statistics. Output per person has\\nincreased 25 times, the percentage of people living below the poverty line has\\nfallen from 96 percent to less than 1 percent, life expectancy has increased by an\\naverage of about 10 years, and the average number of years of education has\\nincreased by 80 percent. I could go on and on, rattling o\\x00 equally impressive\\nstatistics in virtually every area.\\nCHIN A'S DEVEL OPMEN T SINCE 1949 AND 1978\\n\\xa0 1949 1978 2018 Δ Since\\n1949Δ Since\\n1978\\nRGDP P er Capita* 348 609 15,243 44x 25x\\nShar e of W orld GDP 2% 2% 22% 12x 11x\\nPopulation Below the\\nPoverty Line\\n($1.90/Da y)**— 96% 1% at least\\n-96%-96%\\nLife Expectancy 41 66 77 +36 Y rs +11 Y rs\\nInfant Mor tality Rate (per\\n1,000 Bir ths)200 53 7 -96% -86%\\nUrbanization 18% 18% 59% +41% +41%\\nLiter acy 47% 66% 97% +50% +31%\\nAvg Yrs of E ducation 1.7 4.4 7.9 +6.2 Y rs +3.5 Y rs\\n*USD 2017, PPP-adjusted\\n**The W orld Bank only has po verty data back t o 1981\\nWhile the indicators of China’s rise are broadly representative, they aren’t\\nprecise because the powers can’t be precisely measured. Take education, for\\nexample. While our index for education rises at a fairly brisk pace, it fails to fullycapture the relative improvements in China because it is made up of average as\\nwell as total levels of education. This distortion is best conveyed in the next table.\\nAs you can see, while the average education level in China is considerably below\\nthe average education level in the US, China’s total number of people who have\\nattained higher-level education is signi\\x00cantly greater than the United States’. Its\\ntotal number of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) graduates is\\nabout three times the United States’. At the same time, there are reasons to\\nbelieve that the average quality of Chinese education isn’t as high, especially at\\nthe college level. For example, in a recent ranking, only two Chinese universities\\nappeared among the top 50 universities in the world (Tsinghua University at\\nnumber 29 and Peking University at number 49) while 30 American universities\\ndid. This picture, in which the average of something in China is below the\\naverage of the same thing in the United States but the total in China is greater\\nthan the total in the US, is because the average level of development in China is\\nlower while the Chinese population is more than four times as large as the\\nAmerican population. That comes across in a number of stats. For example,\\nwhile the United States is militarily stronger in total all over the world, the\\nChinese appear to be militarily stronger in the East and South China Seas area,\\nand there is a lot that is unknown about both countries’ military powers because\\nthey are kept secret.\\n\\xa0 UNITED ST ATES CHIN A\\n\\xa0 1980 TodayChange Change\\n(%)1980 TodayChange Change\\n(%)\\nAverage Y ears of\\nSchooling11.9 13.6 +1.7 +14% 4.6 7.9 +3.3 +72%\\nGovt Spending on\\nEducation (% of\\nGDP)5.30% 5.50% 0.20% +4% 1.90% 5.20% 3.30% +174%\\nEst P opulation w/\\nTertiary Education\\n(Mln)25 60 +35 +140% 3 120 +117 +3,900%\\xa0 UNITED ST ATES CHIN A\\n\\xa0 1980 TodayChange Change\\n(%)1980 TodayChange Change\\n(%)\\nPopulation w/\\nTertiary Education\\n(% W orking-Age\\nPop)17% 28% 11% +68% 1% 12% 11% +2,272%\\nPopulation w/\\nTertiary Education\\n(% W orld)35% 15% -20% -57% 4% 31% +27% +590%\\nSTEM Majors\\n(Mln)3 8 +5 +141% 1 21 +21 +4,120%\\nSTEM Majors (%\\nWorld)29% 11% -18% -62% 5% 31% +26% +535%\\nIn conclusion, this modern era for China has led to some of the most\\nrapid improvements in basic living conditions in history as well as an\\nobvious climb in the factors that create powerful empires. In all respects,\\nChina is now a major and expanding power. Next we will turn to the US-\\nChina relationship in light of where it is now and what matters most to\\nAmericans and the Chinese.\\n1 The entire report on China’s dynasties is available at economicprinciples.org.\\n2 Among the many inventions of the Song Dynasty were the moveable-type printing press, a compass for\\nnavigation, and paper currency.\\n3 China’s share of world GDP rose to 30 percent and the population more than doubled during the 1700s.\\n4 To clarify, most dynasties were minor, short-lived dynasties or regional dynasties that swiftly rose and fell\\nduring periods of instability in China. Di\\x00erent sources give di\\x00erent numbers for the total number of\\ndynasties because it’s not even clear what constituted a minor or regional dynasty versus some other form of\\nadministration. Concerning the major dynasties, there were roughly nine that uni\\x00ed China and often\\nruled for extended periods. This group includes the \\x00ve our case study focuses on from 600 to the present\\n(the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing), and four from the 800 years prior (the Qin, Han, Jin, and Sui).\\n5 Typically, the “bad” emperors were distant from managing the a\\x00airs of the empire and tolerated—or\\neven participated in—corruption while ignoring public investment needs. Several were known for greater\\nideological rigidity, for their poor judgement and the poor judgment of their top advisors, and for beingpreoccupied with the luxuries that their positions a\\x00orded them. The last emperors of most dynasties often\\ncame after the dynasty was already weakened and often had limited control or even involvement in political\\nevents (e.g., child emperors).\\n6 “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can,\\nand the wisdom to know the di\\x00erence.”\\n7 I’d like to thank Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia and current president and CEO of the\\nAsia Society Policy Institute, for pointing me to these books and helping me understand Chinese politics.\\n8 Because China’s population is about four times as large as the US’s, it only takes an income that is half as\\nmuch per capita to have twice as much in total. There is nothing that I can see that stands in the way of\\nChina and the US having comparable per capita incomes over time, which would make China four times\\nbigger.\\n9 The Made in China 2025 plan is for China to be largely self-su\\x00cient in most areas and to be world\\nleaders in high-tech \\x00elds, including arti\\x00cial intelligence, robotics, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and\\naerospace.\\n10 In March 2021 China released their 14th Five-Year Plan and targets for 2035.\\n11 If you haven’t read Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, I suggest you do to get the \\x00avor of what I am referring to.\\n12 In his excellent book The Chinese World Order: Traditional China’s Foreign Relations, the historian John\\nFairbank described China’s relations with non-Chinese states as follows: “The graded and concentric\\nhierarchy of China’s foreign relations included other peoples and countries which we may group into three\\nmain zones—\\x00rst, the Sinic Zone, consisting of the most nearby and culturally similar tributaries, Korea\\nand Vietnam, parts of which had anciently been ruled within the Chinese empire, and also Liu-ch’iu\\n(Ryuku) Islands and, at brief times, Japan. Secondly, the Inner Asian Zone, consisting of tributary tribes\\nand states of the nomadic or seminomadic peoples of Inner Asia who were not only ethnically and\\nculturally non-Chinese but were also outside or on the fringes of the Chinese cultural area, even though\\nsometimes pressing upon the Great Wall frontier. Third, the Outer Zone, consisting of the ‘outer\\nbarbarians’ (wai-i) generally, at further distance overland or sea, including eventually Japan and other states\\nof Southeast and South Asia and Europe that were supposed to send tribute when trading.”\\n13 I produced this diagram working with Professor Jiaming Zhu.\\n14 These promissory notes were similar to what today would be called a bill of exchange. Earlier promissory\\nnotes were denominated in variable units, but eventually government-issued notes were in \\x00xed\\ndenominations. The government o\\x00ce issued these notes (known as jiaozi and huizi) in exchange for cash\\ncoins.\\n15 The devaluations in 1985–86 and 1993 came after a period of opening up trade and an expansion in\\nSpecial Economic Zones. These openings created immense demand for foreign currency and imports to\\nbuild production capacity—but it would still be a couple more years before those zones yielded much\\nhigher exports. That mismatch contributed to China’s growing current account de\\x00cit.16 The massive Taiping Rebellion—one of the bloodiest wars in human history, which led to an estimated\\n20–30 million killed—caused a giant \\x00scal crisis that led to an issuance of debt that got monetized and led\\nto high in\\x00ation.\\n17 Ji Chaozhu was raised in the United States until he was a junior at Harvard. His brother was close to\\nZhou Enlai, who sent the brother and Ji Chaozhu to the United States to try to build good relations with\\nAmericans. When the Korean War broke out he returned to China, became Zhou’s interpreter, and later\\nserved in the \\x00rst Chinese delegation to the UN and as China’s ambassador to England. While he told me a\\nlot that I won’t discuss to respect his privacy, I don’t believe that this is sensitive information.\\n18 I never ask questions that put them in the awkward position of having to choose between conveying\\ncon\\x00dential information and having to decline my request. I make it clear at all times that my sole desire is\\nto understand and help.CHAPTER 13\\nUS-CHINA RELATIONS AND WARS\\nIn this chapter I will be looking at the positions that the US and China\\nnow \\x00nd themselves in and what being in these positions means for US-\\nChina relations. Because the US and China are now rival powers in a\\nnumber of domains, they are in “con\\x00icts” or “wars” in these domains, so\\nI will be looking at where these stand. Because for the most part these are\\njust new versions of old and classic con\\x00icts (e.g., new technologies in a\\nclassic technology war, new weapons in a classic military war, etc.), I will\\nbe putting them in the context of what has happened repeatedly in\\nhistory and with the timeless and universal principles we have learned\\nfrom studying these cases. While I will explore the range of possibilities that\\none might consider, I will be doing that without getting into what the future\\nmight look like. I will do that in the concluding chapter of this book. In this\\nchapter I will also be moving a bit more from just conveying facts to sharing\\nopinions (i.e., sharing my uncertain conjectures).\\nI am primarily focusing on US-China relations in this chapter, but in truth\\nthe game macro investors and global policy makers are playing is like\\nmultidimensional chess that requires each player to consider the many positions\\nand possible moves of a number of key players (i.e., countries) that are also\\nplaying the game, with each of these players having a wide range of\\nconsiderations (economic, political, military, etc.) that they have to weigh to\\nmake their moves well. The relevant other players that are now in this\\nmultidimensional game include Russia, Japan, India, other Asian countries,\\nAustralia, and European countries, and all of them have many considerationsand constituents that will determine their moves. From playing the game I play\\n—global macro investing—I know how complicated it is to simultaneously\\nconsider all that is relevant in order to make winning decisions. I also know that\\nwhat I do is not as complicated as what those in the seats of power do and I\\nknow that I don’t have access to information that is as good as what they have, so\\nit would be arrogant for me to think I know better than they do about what’s\\ngoing on and how to best handle it. For those reasons I am o\\x00ering my views\\nwith humility. With that equivocation I will tell you how I see the US-China\\nrelationship and the world setting in light of these wars, and I will be brutally\\nhonest.\\nTHE POSITIONS THE AMERICANS AND\\nCHINESE ARE IN\\nAs I see it, destiny and the Big Cycle manifestations of it have put these\\ntwo countries and their leaders in the positions they are now in. They led\\nthe United States to go through its mutually reinforcing Big Cycle\\nsuccesses, which led to excesses that led to weakening in a number of\\nareas. Similarly they led China to go through its Big Cycle declines,\\nwhich led to intolerably bad conditions that led to revolutionary changes\\nand to the mutually reinforcing upswings that China is now in. So, the\\nUnited States appears to be in decline and China appears to be on the rise\\nfor the all the classic reasons.\\nDestiny and the big debt cycle led the US to \\x00nd itself now in the late-cycle\\nphase of the long-term debt cycle in which it has too much debt and needs to\\nrapidly produce much more debt, which it can’t service with hard currency. So it\\nhas to monetize its debt in the classic late-cycle way of printing money to fund\\nthe government’s de\\x00cits. Ironically, and classically, being in this bad position is\\nthe consequence of the United States’ successes leading to these excesses. For\\nexample, it is because of the United States’ great global successes that the\\nUS dollar became the world’s dominant reserve currency, which allowedAmericans to borrow excessively from the rest of the world (including\\nfrom China), which put the US in the tenuous position of owing other\\ncountries (including China) a lot of money which has put those other\\ncountries in the tenuous position of holding the debt of an overly\\nindebted country that is rapidly increasing and monetizing its debt and\\nthat pays signi\\x00cantly negative real interest rates to those holding its\\ndebt. In other words, it is because of the classic reserve currency cycle that China\\nwanted to save a lot in the world’s reserve currency, which led it to lend so much\\nto Americans who wanted to borrow so much, which has put the Chinese and\\nthe Americans in this awkward big debtor-creditor relationship when these wars\\nare going on between them.\\nDestiny and the way the wealth cycle works, especially under capitalism, led\\nto incentives and resources being put into place that allowed Americans to make\\ngreat advances and produce great wealth—and eventually created the large\\nwealth gaps that are now causing con\\x00icts and threatening the domestic order\\nand productivity that is required for the US to stay strong. In China it was the\\nclassic collapse of its \\x00nances due to debt and money weaknesses, internal\\ncon\\x00icts, and con\\x00icts with foreign powers that led to its Big Cycle\\n\\x00nancial declines at the same time that the US was ascending, and it was\\nthe extremity of these terrible conditions that produced the revolutionary\\nchanges that eventually led to the creation of incentives and market/capitalist\\napproaches that produced China’s great advances, great wealth, and the large\\nwealth gaps that it is understandably increasingly concerned about.\\nSimilarly, destiny and the way the global power cycle works have now put the\\nUnited States in the unfortunate position of having to choose between \\x00ghting\\nto defend its position and its existing world order or retreating. For example, it is\\nbecause the United States won the war in the Paci\\x00c in World War II that it,\\nrather than any other country, will have to choose between defending Taiwan—\\nmost Americans don’t know where in the world it is or how to spell it—or\\nretreating. It is because of that destiny and that global power cycle that the\\nUnited States now has military bases in more than 70 countries in order to\\ndefend its world order even though it is uneconomical to do so. History has shown that all countries’ success depends on sustaining the strengthening\\nforces without pr oducing the ex cesses that lead t o countries’ declines. The r eally successful\\ncountries have been able to do that in a big way for 200–300 years. No countr y has been\\nable t o do it for ever.\\nThus far we’ve looked at the history of the last 500 years focusing especially\\non the rise and decline cycles of the Dutch, British, and American reserve\\ncurrency empires and brie\\x00y at the last 1,400 years of China’s dynasties, which\\nhas brought us up to the present. The goal has been to put where we are in the\\ncontext of the big-picture stories that got us here and to see the cause/e\\x00ect\\npatterns of how things work so that we can put where we are into better\\nperspective. Now we need to drop down and look at where we are in more\\ndetail, hopefully without losing sight of that big picture. As we drop down,\\nthings that seem imperceptibly small in retrospect—Huawei, Hong Kong\\nsanctions, closing consulates, moving battleships, unprecedented monetary\\npolicies, political \\x00ghts, social con\\x00icts, and many others—w ill at the time\\nappear much larger, and we will \\x00nd ourselves in the blizzard of them that comes\\nat us every day. Each warrants more than a chapter-long examination, which I\\ndon’t intend to do here, but I will touch on the major issues.\\nHistory has taught us that there are \\x00ve major types of wars: 1)\\ntrade/economic wars, 2) technology wars, 3) geopolitical wars, 4) capital\\nwars, and 5) military wars. To these I would add 6) culture wars and 7)\\nthe war with ourselves. While all sensible people wish that these “wars”\\nweren’t occurring and instead that cooperation was happening, we must be\\npractical in recognizing that they exist. We should use past cases in history and\\nour understandings of actual developments as they are taking place to think\\nabout what is most likely to happen next and how to deal with it well.\\nWe see these wars transpiring in varying degrees now. They should\\nnot be mistaken for individual con\\x00icts but rather recognized as\\ninterrelated con\\x00icts that are extensions of one bigger evolving con\\x00ict.\\nIn watching them transpire we need to observe and try to understand\\neach side’s strategic goals—e.g., are they trying to hasten a con\\x00ict (which\\nsome Americans think is best for the US because time is on China’s side because\\nChina is growing its strengths at a faster pace) or are they trying to ease thecon\\x00icts (because they believe that they would be better o\\x00 if there is no war)?\\nIn order to prevent these con\\x00icts from escalating out of control, it will be\\nimportant for leaders of both countries to be clear about what the “red lines”\\nand “trip wires” are that signal changes in the seriousness of the con\\x00ict.\\nLet’s now take a look at these wars with the lessons from history and the\\nprinciples they provide in mind.\\nTHE TRADE/ECONOMIC WAR\\nLike all wars, the trade war can go from being a polite dispute to being\\nlife-threatening, depending on how far the combatants want to take it.\\nThus far we haven’t seen the US-China trade war taken very far. It\\nfeatures classic tari\\x00s and import restrictions that are reminiscent of those we\\nhave repeatedly seen in other similar periods of con\\x00ict (e.g., the Smoot-Hawley\\nTari\\x00 Act of 1930). We have seen the trade negotiations and what they achieved\\nre\\x00ected in a very limited “phase one” trade agreement from 2019 that was\\ntentatively implemented. As we have seen, this “negotiation” was about testing\\neach other’s powers rather than looking to global laws and judges (like the World\\nTrade Organization) to achieve fair resolution. Tests of power are how all these\\nwars will be fought. The big question is how far these tests of power will go and\\nwhat form will they take.\\nBeyond the trade dispute there are three major economic criticisms\\nthe US has about China’s handling of its economy:\\n1. The Chinese government pursues a wide range of evolving\\ninterventionist policies and practices aimed at limiting market access\\nfor imported goods, services, and businesses, thus protecting its domestic\\nindustries by creating unfair practices.\\n2. The Chinese o\\x00er signi\\x00cant government guidance, resources, and\\nregulatory support to Chinese industries, most notably includingpolicies designed to extract advanced technologies from foreign companies,\\nparticularly in sensitive sectors.\\n3. The Chinese are stealing intellectual property, with some of this\\nstealing believed to be state-sponsored and some of it believed to be outside\\nthe government’s direct control.\\nGenerally speaking, the United States has responded both by trying to alter\\nwhat the Chinese are doing (e.g., to get them to open their markets to\\nAmericans) and by doing its own versions of these things (closing American\\nmarkets to the Chinese). Americans won’t admit to doing some of the things\\nthey are doing (e.g., taking intellectual property) any more than the Chinese will\\nadmit to doing them because the public relations costs of admitting to doing\\nthem are too great. When they are looking for supporters of their causes, all\\nleaders want to appear to be the leaders of the army that is \\x00ghting for good\\nagainst the evil army that is doing bad things. That is why we hear accusations\\nfrom both sides that the other is doing evil things and no disclosures of the\\nsimilar things that they are doing.\\n When things ar e going well it is easy t o keep the mor al high gr ound. Howe ver, when the\\nﬁghting gets tough, it becomes easier to justify doing that which was previously consider ed\\nimmor al (though rather than calling it immor al it is called moral). As the \\x00ghting\\nbecomes tougher a dichotomy emerges between the idealistic descriptions of\\nwhat is being done (which is good for public relations within the country) and\\nthe practical things that are being done to win. That is because in wars leaders\\nwant to convince their constituents that “we are good and they are evil” because\\nthat is the most e\\x00ective way to rally people’s support, in some cases to the point\\nthat they are willing to kill or die for the cause. Though true, it is not easy to\\ninspire people if a practical leader explains that “there are no laws in war” other\\nthan the ethical laws people impose on themselves and “we have to play by the\\nsame rules they play by or we will stupidly \\x00ght by self-imposing that we do it\\nwith one hand behind our backs.”\\nI believe that we have pretty much seen the best trade agreement that\\nwe are going to see and that the risks of this war worsening are greater\\nthan the likelihood that they will lessen, and that we won’t see any treatyor tari\\x00 changes anytime soon from the Biden administration. Whatever\\napproach they eventually take will be a big in\\x00uence on how Americans and the\\nChinese approach the Big Cycle destinies that are in the process of unfolding. As\\nit now stands, the one thing—maybe the only thing—th at both US political\\nparties agree on is being hawkish on China. How hawkish and how exactly that\\nhawkishness is expressed and reacted to by the Chinese are now unknown.\\nHow could this war worsen?\\nClassically, the most dangerous part of the trade/economic war comes\\nwhen countries cut others o\\x00 from essential imports. The case study of the\\nUS and Japan leading up to World War II (found in Chapter 6) is a useful\\nanalogue to US-China circumstances because the geographies and the issues are\\nanalogous. For example, the US cutting o\\x00 China’s imports of oil, other needed\\ncommodities, technologies, and/or other essential imports from the US or other\\ncountries would be clear and obvious signs of the war escalating. Likewise,\\nChina could escalate by cutting o\\x00 companies like General Motors (which sells\\nmore cars in China than in the US) and Apple, or cutting o\\x00 US imports of rare\\nearth elements that are needed for the production of lots of high-tech items,\\nautomobile engines, and defense systems. I’m not saying such moves are likely,\\nbut I do want to be clear that moves to cut o\\x00 essential imports from either\\nside would signal a major escalation that could lead to a much worse\\ncon\\x00ict. If that doesn’t happen, evolution will take its normal course so\\ninternational balances of payments will evolve primarily based on each country’s\\nevolving competitiveness.\\nFor these reasons both countries, especially China, are shifting to more\\ndomestic production and “decoupling.”1 As President Xi has said, the world\\nis “undergoing changes not seen in a century” and “[i]n the face of an external\\nenvironment characterized by rising protectionism, global economic downturn,\\nand a shrinking international market… [China must] give full play to the\\nadvantage of a huge domestic market.” Over the last 40 years it has acquired the\\nabilities to do this. Over the next \\x00ve years we should see both countries become\\nmore independent from each other. The rate of reducing one’s dependencies\\nthat can be cut o\\x00 will be much greater for China over the next \\x00ve to 10 years\\nthan for the United States.THE TECHNOLOGY WAR\\nThe technology war is much more serious than the trade/economic war\\nbecause whoever wins the technology war will probably also win the\\nmilitary wars and all the other wars.\\nThe US and China are now the dominant players in the world’s big tech\\nsectors and these big tech sectors are the industries of the future. The Chinese\\ntech sector has rapidly developed domestically to serve the Chinese in\\nChina and to become a competitor in world markets. At the same time\\nChina remains highly dependent on technologies from the United States\\nand other countries. That makes the United States vulnerable to the increased\\ndevelopment and competition of Chinese technologies and makes the Chinese\\nvulnerable to being cut o\\x00 from essential technologies.\\nThe United States appears now to have greater technology abilities\\noverall, though it varies by type of technology and the US is losing its\\nlead. For example, while the US is ahead in advanced AI chip development, it is\\nbehind in 5G. As an imperfect re\\x00ection of the present stage of the US’s\\nadvantage, the market capitalizations of US tech companies in total are about\\nfour times the size of China’s. This calculation understates China’s relative\\nstrength because it doesn’t include some of the big private companies (like\\nHuawei and Ant Group) and the non-company (i.e., government) technology\\ndevelopments, which are larger in China than they are in the United States. The\\nlargest public Chinese tech companies (Tencent and Alibaba) are already the\\nseventh and eighth largest technology companies in the world, right behind\\nsome of the largest US “FAAMG” stocks. Some of the most important\\ntechnology areas are being led by the Chinese. Consider that 40 percent of the\\nworld’s largest civilian supercomputers are now in China, and it is leading in\\nsome dimensions of the AI/big data race and some dimensions of the quantum\\ncomputing/encryption/communications race. Similar leads in other\\ntechnologies exist, such as in \\x00ntech where the volume of e-commerce\\ntransactions and mobile-based payments in China is the highest in the world and\\nwell ahead of that in the US. There are likely technologies that even the US’smost informed intelligence services don’t know about that are being developed\\nin secret.\\nChina will probably advance its technologies, and the quality of\\ndecision making that is enabled by them, faster than the US will because\\nbig data + big AI + big computing = superior decision making. The\\nChinese are collecting vastly more data per person than is collected in the US\\n(and they have more than four times as many people), and they are investing\\nheavily in AI and big computing to make the most of it. The amount of\\nresources that are being poured into these and other technology areas is far\\ngreater than those in the US. As for providing money, both venture capitalists\\nand the government are providing virtually unlimited amounts to Chinese\\ndevelopers. As for providing people, the number of science, technology,\\nengineering, and math (STEM) graduates that are coming out of college and\\npursuing tech careers in China is about eight times that in the US. The United\\nStates has an overall technology lead (though it is behind in some areas) and of\\ncourse has some big hubs for new innovations, especially in its top universities\\nand its big tech companies. While the US isn’t out of the game, its relative\\nposition is declining because China’s technological innovation abilities are\\nimproving at a faster pace. Remember that China is a country whose leaders 37\\nyears ago marveled at the handheld calculators I gave them. Imagine where they\\nmight be 37 years from now.\\nTo \\x00ght the technology threats, the United States has responded at\\ntimes by preventing Chinese companies (like Huawei) from operating in\\nthe United States, trying to undermine their usage internationally, and\\npossibly hurting their viability through sanctions that prevent them\\nfrom getting items needed for production. Is the United States doing that\\nbecause China is using these companies to spy in the United States and\\nelsewhere, because the United States is worried about them and other Chinese\\ntechnology companies being more competitive, and/or because they are\\nretaliating for the Chinese not allowing American tech companies to have free\\naccess to the Chinese market? While that is debatable, there is no doubt that\\nthese and other Chinese companies are becoming more competitive at a fast\\npace. In response to this competitive threat the United States is moving tocontain or kill threatening tech companies. Interestingly, while the United States\\nis cutting o\\x00 access to intellectual property now, it would have had a much\\ngreater power to do so not long ago because the United States had so much more\\nintellectual property relative to others. China has started to do the same to the\\nUnited States, which will increasingly hurt because Chinese IP is becoming\\nbetter in many ways.\\nRegarding the stealing of technologies, while it is generally agreed to\\nbe a big threat,2 it does not fully explain actions taken against Chinese\\ntech companies. If a company is breaking a law within a country (e.g., Huawei\\nin the US) one would expect to see that crime prosecuted legally so one could see\\nthe evidence that shows the spying devices embedded within the technologies.\\nWe aren’t seeing this. Fear of growing competitiveness is as large, or larger, a\\nmotivator of the attacks on Chinese technology companies, but one can’t expect\\npolicy makers to say that. American leaders can’t admit that the competitiveness\\nof US technology is slipping and can’t argue against allowing free competition to\\nthe American people, who for ages have been taught to believe that competition\\nis both fair and the best process for producing the best results.\\nStealing intellectual property has been going on for as long as there has been\\nrecorded history and has always been di\\x00cult to prevent. As we saw in earlier\\nchapters, the British did it to the Dutch and the Americans did it to the British.\\n“Stealing” implies breaking a law. When the war is between countries there are\\nno laws, judges, or juries to resolve disputes and the real reasons decisions are\\nmade aren’t always disclosed by those who are making them. I don’t mean to\\nimply that the reasons behind the United States’ aggressive actions are not good\\nones; I don’t know if they are. I’m just saying that they might not be exactly as\\nstated. Protectionist policies have long existed to insulate companies from\\nforeign competition. Huawei’s technology is certainly threatening because it’s\\nbetter in some ways than American technology. Look at Alibaba and Tencent\\nand compare them with American equivalents. Americans might ask why these\\ncompanies are not competing in the US. It is mostly for the same reasons that\\nAmazon and a number of other American tech companies aren’t freely\\ncompeting in China. In any case, there is a tech decoupling going on that ispart of the greater decoupling of China and the US, which will have a\\nhuge impact on what the world will look like in \\x00ve years.\\nWhat would a worsening of the tech war look like?\\nThe United States has a technology lead (though it’s shrinking fast).\\nAs a result, the Chinese currently have great dependencies on imported\\ntechnologies from both US and non-US sources that the US can\\nin\\x00uence. This creates a great vulnerability for China, which in turn\\ncreates a great weapon for the United States. It most obviously exists in\\nadvanced semiconductors, though it exists in other technologies as well. The\\ndynamic with the world’s leading chip maker—T aiwan Semiconductor\\nManufacturing Company, which provides the Chinese and the world with\\nneeded chips, and which can be in\\x00uenced by the United States—is one of many\\ninteresting dynamics to watch, especially since it is located in Taiwan. There are\\nmany such Chinese technology imports that are essential to China’s well-being\\nand many fewer American imports from China that are essential to the United\\nStates’ well-being. If the United States shuts o\\x00 Chinese access to essential\\ntechnologies, that would signal a major step up in the risk of a shooting\\nwar. On the other hand, if events continue to transpire as they have been\\ntranspiring, China is poised to be much more independent and in a much\\nstronger position than the United States technologically in \\x00ve to 10 years, at\\nwhich time we will likely see these technologies much more decoupled. This\\npicture changes by the day, and it is important to stay on top of it.\\nTHE GEOPOLITICAL WAR\\nSovereignty, especially as it relates to the Chinese mainland, Taiwan,\\nHong Kong, and the East and South China Seas, is probably China’s\\nbiggest issue. Beyond these are several other areas of strategic economic\\nimportance, such as those countries involved in China’s Belt and Road\\nInitiative.As you might imagine, the Century of Humiliation in the 19th century and\\nthe invasions by foreign “barbarians” during it gave Mao and the Chinese leaders\\nto this day compelling motivations to have complete sovereignty within their\\nborders, get back the parts of China that were taken away from them (e.g.,\\nTaiwan and Hong Kong), and never again be so weak that they can be pushed\\naround by foreign powers. China’s desire for sovereignty and for maintaining its\\ndistinct ways of doing things (i.e., its culture) are why the Chinese reject\\nAmerican demands for them to change Chinese internal policies (e.g., to be\\nmore democratic, to handle the Tibetans and Uighurs di\\x00erently, to change its\\napproach to Hong Kong and Taiwan, etc.). In private some Chinese point out\\nthat they don’t dictate how the United States should treat people within its\\nborders. They also believe that the United States and European countries are\\nculturally prone to proselytizing—i.e., to imposing on others their values, Judeo-\\nChristian beliefs, morals, and ways of operating—and that this inclination has\\ndeveloped through the millennia, since before the Crusades.\\nTo the Chinese the sovereignty risk and the proselytizing risk make a\\ndangerous combination that could threaten China’s ability to be all it can be by\\nfollowing the approaches that it believes are best. The Chinese believe that their\\nhaving sovereignty and the ability to approach things the way that they believe is\\nbest as determined by their hierarchical governance structure is sacrosanct.\\nRegarding the sovereignty issue, they also point out that there are reasons for\\nthem to believe that the United States would topple their government—the\\nChinese Communist Party—if it could, which is also intolerable.3 These are the\\nbiggest existential threats that I believe the Chinese would \\x00ght to the death to\\ndefend and the United States must be careful in dealing with China if it wants to\\nprevent a hot war. For issues not involving sovereignty, I believe the Chinese\\nexpect to look to in\\x00uence them nonviolently and avoid a hot war.\\nProbably the most dangerous sovereignty issue is Taiwan. Many\\nChinese people believe that the United States will never follow through with its\\nimplied promise to allow Taiwan and China to unite, unless the US is forced to\\ndo so. They point out that when the US sells the Taiwanese F-16 \\x00ghter jets and\\nother weapons systems it sure doesn’t look like the United States is facilitating\\nthe peaceful reuni\\x00cation of China. As a result, they believe that the only way toensure that China is safe and united is to have the power to oppose the US in the\\nhope that the US will sensibly acquiesce when faced with a greater Chinese\\npower. My understanding is that China is now stronger militarily in that region\\nof the world. Also, the Chinese military is likely to get stronger at a faster pace,\\nthough deterrence through mutually assured destruction is most likely the case.\\nSo, as I mentioned earlier, I would worry a lot if we were to see an emerging\\n\\x00ght over sovereignty, especially if we were to see a “Fourth Taiwan\\nStrait Crisis.” Would the US \\x00ght to defend Taiwan? Uncertain. The US not\\n\\x00ghting would be a great geopolitical win for China and a great humiliation for\\nthe US. It would signal the decline of the US Empire in the Paci\\x00c and beyond\\nin much the same way as the British loss of the Suez Canal signaled the end of\\nthe British Empire in the Middle East and beyond. The implications of that\\nwould extend well beyond that loss. For example, in the British case it signaled\\nthe end of the pound as a reserve currency. The more of a show the US makes of\\ndefending Taiwan the greater the humiliation of a lost war or a retreat would be.\\nThat is concerning because the United States has been making quite a show of\\ndefending Taiwan while destiny appears to be bringing a direct con\\x00ict to a head\\nbefore long. If the US does \\x00ght, I believe that a war with China over Taiwan\\nthat costs American lives would be very unpopular in the US and the US would\\nprobably lose that \\x00ght, so the big question is whether that would lead to a\\nbroader war. That scares everyone. Hopefully the fear of that great war and the\\ndestruction it would produce, like the fear of mutually assured destruction, will\\nprevent it.\\nAt the same time, from my discussions it is my belief that China has a\\nstrong desire not to have a hot war with the US or to forcibly control\\nother countries (as distinct from having the desire to be all it can be and\\nto in\\x00uence countries within its region). I know that the Chinese leadership\\nunderstands how terrible a hot war would be and worries about unintentionally\\nslipping into one, à la World War I. They would much prefer a cooperative\\nrelationship if such a relationship is possible, and, I suspect, they would happily\\ndivide the world into di\\x00erent spheres of in\\x00uence. Still they have their “red\\nlines” (i.e., limits to what can be compromised on that if crossed would lead to a\\nhot war) and they expect more challenging times ahead. For example, asPresident Xi said in his 2019 New Year’s address, “Looking at the world at large,\\nwe are facing a period of major change never seen in a century. No matter what\\nthese changes bring, China will remain resolute and con\\x00dent in its defense of\\nnational sovereignty and security.”4\\nRegarding in\\x00uence around the world, for both the United States and\\nChina there are certain areas that each \\x00nds most important, primarily\\non the bases of proximity (they care most about countries and areas\\nclosest to them) and/or of obtaining essentials (they care most about not\\nbeing cut o\\x00 from essential minerals and technologies), and to a lesser\\nextent of their export markets. The areas that are most important to the\\nChinese are \\x00rst those that they consider to be part of China, second those on\\ntheir borders (in the China seas) and those in key supply lanes (Belt and Road\\ncountries) or those that are suppliers of key imports, and third other countries of\\neconomic or strategic importance for partnerships.\\nOver the past few years China has signi\\x00cantly expanded its activities in these\\nstrategically important countries, especially Belt and Road countries, resource-\\nrich developing countries, and some developed countries. This is greatly\\na\\x00ecting geopolitical relations. These activities are economic and are occurring\\nvia increasing investments in targeted countries (e.g., loans, purchases of assets,\\nbuilding infrastructure facilities such as roads and stadiums, and providing\\nmilitary and other support to countries’ leaders) while the US is receding from\\nproviding aid to these places. This economic globalization has been so extensive\\nthat most countries have had to think hard about their policies regarding\\nallowing the Chinese to buy assets within their borders.\\nGenerally speaking, the Chinese appear to want tributary-like\\nrelationships with most non-rival countries, though the closer their\\nproximity to China, the greater the in\\x00uence China wants over them. In\\nreaction to these changing circumstances most countries, in varying\\ndegrees, are wrestling with the question of whether it is better to be\\naligned with the United States or with China, with those in closest\\nproximity needing to give the most consideration to this question. In\\ndiscussions with leaders from di\\x00erent parts of the world I have repeatedly heard\\nit said that there are two overriding considerations—economic and military.They almost all say that if they were to choose on the basis of economics, they\\nwould choose China because China is more important to them economically (in\\ntrade and capital \\x00ows), while if they were to choose on the basis of military\\nsupport, the United States has the edge but the big question is whether the\\nUnited States will be there to protect them militarily when they need it. Most\\ndoubt that the US will \\x00ght for them, and some in the Asia-Paci\\x00c region\\nquestion whether the US has the power to win.\\nThe economic bene\\x00ts that China is providing these countries is signi\\x00cant\\nand is working in a way that is broadly similar to the way the United States\\nprovided economic bene\\x00ts to key countries after World War II to help secure\\nthe desired relationships. It was not many years ago that there were no signi\\x00cant\\nrivals to the United States, so it was quite easy for the United States to simply\\nexpress its wishes and \\x00nd that most countries would comply; the only rival\\npowers were the Soviet Union (which in hindsight wasn’t much of a rival) and\\nits allies and a few of the developing countries that were not economic rivals.\\nOver the last few years Chinese in\\x00uence over other countries has been\\nexpanding while US in\\x00uence has been receding. That is also true in\\nmultilateral organizations—e.g., the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank,\\nthe World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, and the\\nInternational Court of Justice—most of which were set up by the United States\\nat the beginning of the American world order. As the United States has been\\npulling back from them, these organizations are weakening and China is playing\\na greater role in them.\\nOver the next \\x00ve to 10 years, in addition to there being decoupling in\\nother areas, we will be seeing which countries align themselves with each\\nof these leading powers. Beyond money and military power, how China and\\nthe US interact with other countries (how they use their soft powers) will\\nin\\x00uence how these alliances will be made. Style and values will matter. For\\nexample, during the Trump years I heard leaders around the world describe both\\ncountries’ leaders as “brutal.” While you don’t hear that as much with President\\nBiden, other countries broadly fear that they will be punished if they don’t do\\nexactly what these two countries’ leaders want, and they don’t like it to the point\\nof being driven into the other’s arms. It will be important to see what thesealliances will look like because throughout history, as we’ve seen, the\\nmost powerful country is typically taken down by alliances of countries\\nthat are less powerful but collectively stronger.\\nPerhaps the most interesting relationship to watch is between China and\\nRussia. Since the new world order began in 1945, among China, Russia, and the\\nUnited States, two out of the three have become allied to attempt to neutralize\\nor overpower the third. Russia and China each has a lot of what the other needs\\n(natural resources and military equipment for China from Russia and \\x00nancing\\nfor Russia from China). Also, because Russia is militarily strong it would be a\\ngood military ally. We can start to see this happening by watching where the\\ncountries line up on the issues; for example, whether to allow Huawei in, with\\nthe United States or China.\\nIn addition to the international political risks and opportunities,\\nthere are of course big domestic political risks and opportunities in both\\ncountries. That is because there are di\\x00erent factions who are \\x00ghting\\nfor control of both governments and there will inevitably be changes in\\nleadership that will produce changes in policies. While nearly impossible to\\nanticipate, whoever is in charge will be faced with the challenges that now exist\\nand that are unfolding in the Big Cycle ways we have been discussing. Since all\\nleaders (and all other participants in these evolutionary cycles, including all of\\nus) step on and get o\\x00 at di\\x00erent parts of these cycles, they (and we) face a\\ncertain set of likely situations to be encountered. Since other people in history\\nhave stepped on and o\\x00 at the same parts of past cycles, by studying what these\\nothers encountered and how they handled their encounters at the analogous\\nstages, and by using some logic, we can imperfectly imagine the range of\\npossibilities.\\nTHE CAPITAL WAR\\nAs history has shown, one of the biggest risks in a con\\x00ict is that access\\nto one’s money/capital can be shut o\\x00. This can happen by a) the movesof one’s opponents and/or b) self-in\\x00icted harmful actions (e.g., getting\\ninto too much debt and devaluing one’s money) that lead those who\\nprovide capital to not want to provide it. In Chapter 6, I reviewed classic\\ncapital war moves. Some of these are now being used and could be used in a\\nmore forceful way, so they have to be watched closely.\\nThe goal in a capital war is to cut the enemy o\\x00 from capital because\\nno money = no power.\\nThe degrees to which these things occur correspond to the severity of the\\ncon\\x00ict. “Sanctions” as they are now called and employed come in many forms,\\nwith the broad categories being \\x00nancial, economic, diplomatic, and military.\\nWithin each of these categories there are many versions and applications. I’m not\\ngoing to delve into the various versions and targets because that would be too\\nmuch of a digression.\\nThe main things to know are:\\nThe United States’ greatest power comes from having the world’s\\nleading reserve currency, which gives the US enormous buying\\npower because it gives it the ability a) to print the world’s money\\nand have it widely accepted abroad and b) to control who gets it.\\nThe United States is at risk of losing its reserve currency status.\\nThe US dollar remains the dominant world reserve currency because it is used\\nfor trade, global capital transactions, and reserves much more than any other\\ncurrency. History and logic show that the leading reserve currency is slow to be\\nreplaced for the same reasons that the leading world language is slow to be\\nreplaced—because so many people have adopted it and because it is entwined\\nwithin the system. The existing positions of reserve currencies as re\\x00ected by the\\namounts held by central banks are shown here:\\nSHARE OF CEN TRAL BANK RESER VES B Y CURRENCY\\nUSD 51%\\nEUR 20%Gold 12%\\nJPY 6%\\nGBP 5%\\nCNY 2%\\nBased on data thr ough 2019\\nBecause the dollar is the dominant currency in world trade, capital\\n\\x00ows, and reserves, it is the world’s leading reserve currency, which puts\\nthe US in the enviable position of being able to print the world’s money\\nand to in\\x00ict sanctions on its enemies. The US now has an arsenal of\\nsanctions, which is its most used arsenal of weapons. As of 2019, there were\\napproximately 8,000 US sanctions in place targeted at individuals, companies,\\nand governments. Through these powers the US can get the money it needs and\\nit can cut o\\x00 opposing countries from getting money and credit by preventing\\n\\x00nancial institutions and others from dealing with them. These sanctions are by\\nno means perfect or all-encompassing, but they are generally e\\x00ective.\\nThe United States is at risk of losing its dominant position as a reserve\\ncurrency because:\\nThe amounts of dollar-denominated debt in foreigners’ portfolios,\\nsuch as central bank reserves and sovereign wealth funds, are\\ndisproportionately large based on a number of measures of what the\\nsize of reserve currency holdings should be.5\\nThe US government and the US central bank are increasing the\\namounts of dollar-denominated debt and money at an\\nextraordinarily fast pace, so it will likely be hard to \\x00nd adequate\\ndemand for US debt without the Federal Reserve having to\\nmonetize a lot of it, while at the same time the \\x00nancial incentives\\nto hold this debt are unattractive because the US government is\\npaying a negligible nominal yield and a negative real yield on it.Holding debt as a medium of exchange or as a storehold of wealth\\nduring wartime is less desirable than during peacetime, so if there\\nwere movements toward war, the value of debt (which is a promise\\nto receive \\x00at currency) and \\x00at currency would likely go down\\nrelative to other things. This is not currently an issue but would become\\none if wars intensify.\\nThe roughly $1 trillion of US debt that China holds is a risk but not\\nan unmanageable one as that equals only around 4 percent of the\\nroughly $28 trillion outstanding (as of May 2021). However, because\\nother countries realize that actions taken against China could be\\ntaken against them, any actions taken against Chinese holdings of\\ndollar assets would likely increase the perceived risks of holding\\ndollar-debt assets by other holders of these assets, which would\\nreduce the demand for such assets. This is not currently an issue though\\nit appears to be close to becoming an issue.\\nThe dollar’s role as a reserve currency largely depends on its being\\nfreely exchanged between countries, so to the extent that the US\\nmight in the future put controls on its \\x00ows and/or run monetary\\npolicy in ways that are contrary to the world’s interests in pursuit of\\nits own interests, that would make the dollar less desirable as the\\nworld’s leading reserve currency. This is not currently an issue but will\\nbecome one if foreign exchange controls are raised as a possibility, which is\\ntypical at the next stage of the cycle.\\nCountries being hurt by US sanctions are developing ways to get\\naround them or undermining the United States’ power to impose\\nthem. For example, Russia and China, which both are encountering these\\nsanctions and are at great risk of encountering more of them in the future,\\nare each now developing and cooperating with the other to develop an\\nalternative payment system. China’s central bank has created a digital\\ncurrency, which will make China less exposed to US sanctions.\\nThere are no good currency alternatives because:The dollar (51 percent of central bank reserves) has weakening\\nfundamentals in the way described in Chapter 11, which I won’t repeat\\nhere.\\nThe euro (20 percent) is a weakly structured \\x00at currency made by\\nsmaller, uncoordinated countries with weak \\x00nances that are tenuously\\nheld together by a highly fragmented currency union. Because the\\nEuropean Union is \\x00nancially, economically, and militarily at best a\\nsecondary power, buying its currency and debt denominated in its\\ncurrency, which its central bank is free to print, is not an enticing thing to\\ndo.\\nGold (12 percent) is a hard currency that is held because it has worked the\\nbest over the ages and because it is an e\\x00ective diversi\\x00er to other assets\\nheld, particularly \\x00at currencies. While before 1971 gold was at the\\nfoundation of the world’s currency system, at this time it is a relatively dead\\nasset since there are no signi\\x00cant international trade and capital\\ntransactions in it and it isn’t used to balance external accounts. It is also a\\nmarket that is too small to become a high share of wealth at current prices.\\nA move to gold from \\x00at-currency-based assets (i.e., credit assets), which\\nwould only come in the event of an abandonment of that system (which\\nhistory shows could come), would lead to an explosion in gold’s price.\\nThe yen (6 percent) is a \\x00at currency that is also not widely used\\ninternationally by non-Japanese people and su\\x00ers from a lot of the same\\nproblems that the dollar has including having too much debt that is\\nincreasing quickly and being monetized so that it is paying unattractive\\ninterest rates. Also Japan is only a moderate global economic power and is a\\nweak military power.\\nThe pound (5 percent) is an anachronistically held \\x00at currency that has\\nrelatively weak fundamentals, and the UK is relatively weak in almost all of\\nour measures of a country’s economic/geopolitical power.\\nThe renminbi (2 percent) is the only \\x00at currency to be chosen as a\\nreserve currency because of its fundamentals. China’s potential is sizable.\\nIts shares of world trade, world capital \\x00ows, and world GDP are roughly\\nequal to the United States’.6 China has managed its currency to berelatively stable against other currencies and against goods and services\\nprices, it has large foreign exchange reserves, it doesn’t have a 0 percent\\ninterest rate and a negative real interest rate, and it isn’t printing and\\nmonetizing a lot of debt. Increasing investments in China strengthens the\\ncurrency because those purchases have to be made in its currency. Those\\nare the positives. The negatives are that China has a relatively large amount\\nof domestic debt that has to be restructured, the renminbi is not a currency\\nthat is widely used for global trade and \\x00nancial transactions, China’s\\nclearing system is undeveloped, and money is not allowed to freely \\x00ow in\\nand out of the currency.\\nSo there are no attractive world reserve currencies to compete with the\\ndollar.\\n History has shown that whene ver a) currencies are not desir ed and b) there are no\\nother currencies that are attractiv e to go into, the currencies are still devalued and the\\ncapital ﬁnds its way into other investm ents (e.g., gold, commodities, stocks, proper ty, etc.).\\nAs a result, there is no need to have a strong alternativ e currency for a devaluation of a\\ncurrency t o tak e place.\\nThings will change. To the extent that the United States and China\\nare in a capital war, the development of Chinese currency and capital\\nmarkets would be detrimental for the United States and bene\\x00cial for\\nChina. Without the US attacking China’s currency and capital markets\\nin an attempt to weaken them, and/or the Chinese hurting their own\\ncurrency and capital markets (by making policy shifts that make these\\nmarkets less attractive), China’s currency and capital markets will\\nprobably develop quickly to increasingly compete with US markets. It is\\nup to American policy makers to decide whether or not they will try to\\ndisrupt this evolutionary path by becoming more aggressive or accept\\nthat evolution, which will likely lead to China becoming relatively\\nstronger, more self-su\\x00cient, and less vulnerable to being squeezed by\\nthe US. Though the Chinese have less power to hurt the US dollar and its\\ncapital markets, and its best moves would be to strengthen its own currency,\\nthere are some possibilities that it will attempt to harm the dollar.As explained in my study of past cycles, the war typically intensi\\x00es as the\\ncycle progresses. Comparing historical cases with their modern-day equivalents\\n—e.g., moves by the US and Japan prior to World War II with moves by the US\\nand China now—should be helpful as the cycle progresses.\\nTHE MILITARY WAR\\nI am not a military expert but I get to speak with military experts and I do\\nresearch on the subject, so I will pass along what has been shared with me. Take\\nit or leave it as you wish.\\n It is impossible to visualiz e what the next major militar y war will be like, though it\\nprobably will be much worse than most people imagine.  That is because a lot of\\nweaponry has been developed in secret and because the creativity and capabilities\\nto in\\x00ict pain have grown enormously in all forms of warfare since the last time\\nthe most powerful weapons were used and seen in action. There are now more\\ntypes of warfare than one can imagine and, within each, more weapons systems\\nthan anyone knows. While of course nuclear warfare is a scary prospect, I have\\nheard equally scary prospects of biological, cyber, chemical, space, and other\\ntypes of warfare. Many of these are untested so there is a lot of uncertainty about\\nhow they would go.\\nBased on what we do know the headline is that the United States and\\nChina’s geopolitical war in the East and South China Seas is escalating\\nmilitarily because both sides are testing the other’s limits. China is now\\nmilitarily stronger than the United States in the East and South China\\nSeas so the US would probably lose a war in that region, while the United\\nStates is stronger around the world and overall and would probably\\n“win” a bigger war. But a bigger war is too complicated to imagine well\\nbecause of the large number of unknowns, including how other countries would\\nbehave in it and what technologies secretly exist. The only thing that most\\ninformed people agree on is that such a war would be unimaginably horrible.Also notable, China’s rate of improvement in its military power, like its other\\nrates of improvement, has been extremely fast, especially over the last 10 years,\\nand the future rate is expected to be even faster, even more so if China’s\\neconomic and technological improvements continue to outpace those of the\\nUnited States. Some people imagine that China could achieve broad\\nmilitary superiority in \\x00ve to 10 years. I don’t know if that is true.\\nAs for potential locations of military con\\x00ict, Taiwan, the East and\\nSouth China Seas, and North Korea are the hottest spots, and India and\\nVietnam are the next (for reasons I won’t digress into).\\nAs far as a big hot war between the United States and China is concerned, it\\nwould include all the previously mentioned types of wars plus more pursued at\\ntheir maximums because, in a \\x00ght for survival, each would throw all it has at the\\nother, the way other countries throughout history have. It would be World War\\nIII, and World War III would likely be much deadlier than World War II, which\\nwas much deadlier than World War I because of the technological advances in\\nthe ways we can hurt each other.\\nProxy wars are also part of the picture and should be watched as they are very\\ne\\x00ective in chipping away at a leading world power’s strength and global\\nin\\x00uence.\\nIn thinking about the timing of a war, I keep in mind the principles that: \\nwhen coun tries have big internal disor der, it is an oppor tune moment for opposing countries\\nto aggr essiv ely exploit their vulner abilities.  For example, the Japanese made their\\nmoves to invade China in the 1930s when China was divided and exhausted by\\nits ongoing civil war.\\n History has taught us that when there are leadership transitions and/or weak\\nleadership at the same time that there is big internal conﬂict, the risk of the enemy making\\nan offensiv e move should be consider ed elevated.  Because time is on China’s side, if\\nthere is to be a war, it is in the interest of the Chinese to have it later (e.g., \\x00ve to\\n10 years from now when it will likely be stronger and more self-su\\x00cient) and in\\nthe interest of the US to have it sooner.\\nI’m now going to add two other types of war—th e culture war, which will\\ndrive how each side will approach these circumstances, including what they\\nwould rather die for than give up, and the war with ourselves, which willdetermine how e\\x00ective we are and which will lead us to be strong or weak in the\\ncritical ways we explored in Chapter 1.\\nTHE CULTURE WAR\\n How people are with each other is of paramount impor tance in determining how they will\\nhandle the circums tances that they jointly face, and the cultur es that they have will be the\\nbiggest determinants of how they are with each other . What Americans and the\\nChinese value most and how they think people should be with each other\\ndetermine how they will deal with each other in addressing the con\\x00icts that we\\njust explored. Because Americans and the Chinese have di\\x00erent values and\\ncultural norms that they will \\x00ght and die for, if we are going to get through our\\ndi\\x00erences peacefully it is important that both sides understand what these are\\nand how to deal with them well.\\nAs described earlier, Chinese culture compels its leaders and society to\\nmake most decisions from the top down, demanding high standards of\\ncivility, putting the collective interest ahead of individual interests,\\nrequiring each person to know their role and how to play it well, and\\nhaving \\x00lial respect for those superior in the hierarchy. They also seek\\n“rule by the proletariat,” which in common parlance means that\\nopportunities and rewards are broadly distributed. In contrast,\\nAmerican culture compels its leaders to run the country from the bottom\\nup, demanding high levels of personal freedom, favoring individualism\\nover collectivism, admiring revolutionary thinking and behavior, and not\\nrespecting people for their positions as much as for the quality of their\\nthinking. These core cultural values drove the types of economic and\\npolitical systems each country chose.\\nTo be clear, most of these di\\x00erences aren’t obvious in day-to-day life; they\\ngenerally aren’t very important relative to the shared beliefs that Americans and\\nthe Chinese have, which are numerous, and they aren’t held by all Chinese or all\\nAmericans, which is why many Americans are comfortable living in China andvice versa. Also, they are not pervasive. For example, the Chinese in other\\ndomains, such as Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, have had governance\\nsystems that are similar to Western democratic systems. Still these cultural\\ndi\\x00erences subtly a\\x00ect most everything, and in times of great con\\x00ict, they are\\nthe de\\x00ning di\\x00erences that determine whether the parties \\x00ght or peacefully\\nresolve their disputes. The main challenge the Chinese and Americans have\\nwith each other arises from some of them failing to understand and\\nempathize with the other’s values and ways of doing things, and not\\nallowing each other to do what they think is best.\\nWhile the opening up of both countries has increased their interactions and\\ntheir increasingly shared practices (e.g., their similar economic freedoms that\\nproduce similar desires, products, and outcomes) have made both environments\\nand their people much more similar than they ever were before, the di\\x00erences\\nin approaches are still notable. They are re\\x00ected in how each country’s\\ngovernment and its people interact with each other and how Americans and the\\nChinese interact especially at the leader-to-policy-maker level. Some of these\\ncultural di\\x00erences are minor and some of them are so major that many\\npeople would \\x00ght to the death over them—e.g., most Americans believe in\\n“give me liberty or give me death” while to the Chinese individual liberty isn’t\\nnearly as important as collective stability is.\\nThese di\\x00erences are also re\\x00ected in everyday life. For example, the Chinese\\ngovernment, being more paternal, regulates what types of video games children\\nplay and how many hours a day they can play them, whereas in the United States\\nvideo games aren’t government-regulated because such things are considered an\\nindividual parent’s decision to make. One could argue the merits of either\\napproach.\\nThe Chinese hierarchical culture makes it natural for the Chinese to simply\\naccept the government’s direction, while the American nonhierarchical culture\\nmakes it acceptable for Americans to \\x00ght with their government over what to\\ndo. Similarly, di\\x00erent cultural inclinations in\\x00uenced how Americans and the\\nChinese reacted to being told that they had to wear masks in response to\\nCOVID-19, which led to second-order consequences because the Chinese\\nfollowed the instructions and Americans often didn’t, a\\x00ecting the numbers ofcases and deaths and the economic impact. These culturally determined\\ndi\\x00erences in how things are handled a\\x00ect how the Chinese and Americans\\nreact di\\x00erently to many things— information privacy, free speech, free media,\\netc.—which add up to lots of ways that the countries operate di\\x00erently.\\nWhile there are pros and cons to these di\\x00erent cultural approaches, and I’m\\nnot going to explore them here, I do want to get across that the cultural\\ndi\\x00erences that make Americans American and the Chinese Chinese are\\ndeeply embedded. Given China’s impressive track record and how deeply\\nimbued the culture behind it is, there is no more chance of the Chinese giving\\nup their values and their system than there is of Americans giving up theirs.\\nTrying to force the Chinese and their systems to be more American would, to\\nthem, mean subjugation of their most fundamental beliefs, which they would\\n\\x00ght to the death to protect. To have peaceful coexistence Americans must\\nunderstand that the Chinese believe that their values and their approaches to\\nliving out these values are best, as much as Americans believe their American\\nvalues and their ways of living them out are best.\\nFor example, one should accept the fact that when choosing leaders most\\nChinese believe that having capable, wise leaders make the choices is preferable\\nto having the general population make the choice on a “one person, one vote”\\nbasis because they believe that the general population is less informed and less\\ncapable. Most believe that the general population will choose the leaders on\\nwhims and based on what those seeking to be elected will give them in order to\\nbuy their support rather than what’s best for them. Also, they believe—like\\nPlato believed and as has happened in a number of countries—that democracies\\nare prone to slip into dysfunctional anarchies during very bad times when\\npeople \\x00ght over what should be done rather than support a strong, capable\\nleader.\\nThey also believe that their system of choosing leaders lends itself to better\\nmultigenerational strategic decision making because any one leader’s term is only\\na small percentage of the time that is required to progress along its long-term\\ndevelopmental arc.7 They believe that what is best for the collective is most\\nimportant and best for the country and is best determined by those at the top.\\nTheir system of governance is more like what is typical in big companies,especially multigenerational companies, so they wonder why it is hard for\\nAmericans and other Westerners to understand the rationale for the Chinese\\nsystem following this approach and to see the challenges of the democratic\\ndecision-making process as the Chinese see them.\\nTo be clear, I’m not seeking to explore the relative merits of these decision-\\nmaking systems. I am simply trying to make clear that there are arguments\\non both sides and to help Americans and the Chinese see things through\\neach other’s eyes and, most importantly, to understand that the choice is\\nbetween accepting, tolerating, and even respecting each other’s right to\\ndo what each thinks is best or having the Chinese and Americans \\x00ght to\\nthe death over what they believe is uncompromisable.\\nThe American and Chinese economic and political systems are di\\x00erent\\nbecause of the di\\x00erences in their histories and the di\\x00erences in their cultures\\nthat have resulted from these histories. As far as economics is concerned the two\\ndi\\x00erent viewpoints—the classic left (favoring government ownership of the\\nmeans of production, the poor, the redistribution of wealth, etc., which the\\nChinese call communism) and the classic right (favoring private ownership of\\nthe means of production, whoever succeeds in the system, and much more\\nlimited redistributions of wealth)—exist in China as in the rest of the world, and\\nthere have been swings from one to the other in all societies, especially in China,\\nso it would not be correct to say that the Chinese are culturally left or right.\\nSimilar swings in American preferences have existed throughout its much more\\nlimited history. I suspect that if the United States had a longer history we would\\nhave seen wider swings, as we have in Europe through its longer history.\\nFor these reasons these “left” versus “right” inclinations appear to be more\\nbig cycle swings around revolutionary trends than evolving core values. In fact,\\nwe are seeing these swings now taking place in both countries, so it’s not a big\\nstretch to say that policies of the “right,” such as capitalism, are close to being\\nmore favored in China than in the United States and vice versa. In any case,\\nwhen it comes to economic systems, there don’t appear to be a lot of clear\\ndistinctions rooted in deep cultural preferences. In contrast to economic\\nsystems, the inclination of the Chinese to be top-down/hierarchical versus\\nbottom-up/nonhierarchical appears to be deeply embedded in their culture andin their political systems while Americans are strongly inclined to be bottom-\\nup/nonhierarchical. As for which approach will work best and win out in the\\nend, I will leave that for others to debate, hopefully without bias, though I will\\nnote that most knowledgeable observers of history have concluded that neither\\nof these systems is always good or bad. \\n What works best varies accor ding to a) the\\ncircumstances and b) how people usin g these systems are with each other . No system will\\nsustainably work well—in fact all will break down—if the individuals in it don’t respect it more\\nthan what they individually want and if the system is not ﬂexible enough to bend with the\\ntimes without br eaking.\\nAs we imagine how Americans and the Chinese will handle their\\nshared challenge to evolve in the best possible way on this shared planet, I\\ntry to imagine where their strong cultural inclinations, most importantly\\nwhere the irreconcilable di\\x00erences that they would rather die for than\\ngive up, will lead them. For example, most Americans and most Westerners\\nwould \\x00ght to the death for the ability to have and express their opinions,\\nincluding their political opinions. In contrast, the Chinese value the respect for\\nauthority more, which is re\\x00ected in and demonstrated by the relative powers of\\nindividuals and the organizations they belong to and the responsibility to hold\\nthe collective organization responsible for the actions of individuals in the\\ncollective.\\nSuch a culture clash took place in October 2019 when the then-general\\nmanager of the Houston Rockets (Daryl Morey) tweeted an image expressing\\nsupport for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protest movement. He quickly pulled\\ndown his tweet and explained that his views weren’t representative of his team’s\\nviews or the NBA’s views. Morey was then attacked by the American side (i.e.,\\nthe press, politicians, and the public) for not standing up for free speech, and the\\nChinese side held the whole league responsible and punished it by dropping all\\nNBA games from China’s state television, pulling NBA merchandise from\\nonline stores, and reportedly demanding that the league \\x00re Morey.\\nThis clash arose because of how important free speech is to Americans and\\nbecause Americans believe that the organization should not be punished for the\\nactions of the individual. The Chinese, on the other hand, believe that the\\nharmful attack needed to be punished and that the group should be heldaccountable for the actions of the individuals in it. One can imagine much\\nbigger cases in which much bigger con\\x00icts arise due to such di\\x00erences in deep-\\nseated beliefs about how people should be with each other.\\nWhen they are in a superior position, the Chinese tend to want a) the\\nrelative positions to be clear (i.e., the party in a subordinate position\\nknows that it is in a subordinate position), b) the subordinate party to\\nobey, and c) the subordinate party to know that, if it doesn’t do so, it will\\nbe punished. That is the cultural inclination/style of Chinese leadership. They\\ncan also be wonderful friends who will provide support when needed. For\\nexample, when the governor of Connecticut was desperate to get personal\\nprotective equipment in the \\x00rst big wave of COVID-19 illnesses and deaths and\\ncouldn’t get it from the US government or other American sources, I turned to\\nmy Chinese friends for help and they provided what was needed, which was a\\nlot. As China goes global a number of countries’ leaders (and their populations)\\nhave been both grateful for and put o\\x00 by China’s acts of generosity and strict\\npunishments. Some of these cultural di\\x00erences can be negotiated to the parties’\\nmutual satisfaction, but some of the most important ones will be very di\\x00cult\\nto negotiate away.\\nI think the main thing to realize and accept is that the Chinese and\\nAmericans have di\\x00erent values and will make di\\x00erent choices for\\nthemselves than the other would like. For example, Americans might not like\\nhow the Chinese handle their human rights issues and the Chinese might not\\nlike how Americans handle their human rights issues. The question is: what\\nshould be done about that—should Americans \\x00ght with the Chinese to impose\\nwhat they think the Chinese should do on them and vice versa, or should they\\nagree not to intervene into what each other does? In my opinion it is too\\ndi\\x00cult, inappropriate, and probably impossible to force others in other\\ncountries to do what they strongly believe is not good for them. The United\\nStates’ ability to impose things on the Chinese and China’s ability to\\nimpose things on the United States will be a function of their relative\\npowers.\\nWhile I just explored the US-China war issues conveying the little that I\\nknow about them relative to what I need to know, I want to remind you thatthese wars are far more complex than one-to-one con\\x00icts. They are like\\nmultidimensional chess games because many countries are involved with many\\nother countries in many dimensions. For example, when I think of US-China\\nrelations I have to think way beyond their bilateral relations to think about their\\nmultilateral relationships in all important dimensions—e.g., with all notable\\nAsian, European, and Middle Eastern governments and private sectors, and with\\nall of those countries’ important relationships with the other countries, etc. In\\nother words, in order to think about the US-China relationship I have to think\\nabout the Saudi Arabia-US and the Saudi Arabia-China relationship and to that\\nI have to think about the Saudi Arabia-Iran relationship, the Saudi Arabia-Israel,\\nthe Saudi Arabia-Egypt, and many other relationships in all of their important\\ndimensions, plus the other analogous relationships. Without the aid of a good\\ncomputer and a whole lot of data, it is impossible to follow, let alone\\nunderstand, what’s going on. It is way beyond me, and frankly when I speak\\nwith world leaders I \\x00nd it shocking how little they really understand what the\\nothers in this multidimensional chess game are really thinking.\\nTHE RISK OF UNNECESSARY WAR\\nAs I explained in Chapter 6, stupid wars often happen as a result of a tit-\\nfor-tat escalation process in which responding to even small actions of an\\nadversary is more important than being perceived as weak, especially\\nwhen those on both sides don’t really understand the motivations of\\nthose on the other side. History shows us that this is especially a problem for\\ndeclining empires, which tend to \\x00ght more than is logical because any retreat is\\nseen as a defeat.\\nTake the issue of Taiwan. Even though the US \\x00ghting to defend Taiwan\\nwould seem to be illogical, not \\x00ghting a Chinese attack on Taiwan might be\\nperceived as being a big loss of stature and power over other countries that won’t\\nsupport the US if it doesn’t \\x00ght and win for its allies. Additionally, such defeats\\ncan make leaders look weak to their own people, which can cost them thepolitical support they need to remain in power. And, of course, miscalculations\\ndue to misunderstandings when con\\x00icts are transpiring quickly are dangerous.\\nAll these dynamics create strong pulls toward wars accelerating even though\\nsuch mutually destructive wars are so much worse than cooperating and\\ncompeting in more peaceful ways.\\nThere is also risk of untruthful, emotional rhetoric taking hold in\\nboth the US and China, creating an atmosphere for escalation. For\\nexample, in a recent Pew survey a record 73 percent of Americans had an\\nunfavorable opinion of China, 73 percent believed the United States should\\npromote human rights in China, and 50 percent believed the US should “hold\\nChina responsible” for the role it played in COVID-19. Though I don’t have\\nsurveys of Chinese public opinion of the United States, I am told by many\\npeople that it has deteriorated. It wouldn’t take much to have these people\\ndemand accelerations of the con\\x00icts.\\nUltimately, it would be wise for leaders and citizens of both countries\\nto recognize that the US and China are in a competition of systems and\\nabilities. Each will inevitably follow the system that they believe works best for\\nthem, Americans have a slight lead in power but it is shrinking and they’re\\noutnumbered, and history has shown that while numbers of people can matter a\\nlot, other factors (e.g., the 18 determinants listed in Chapter 2) matter more, so\\neven small-population empires become leading world powers if they manage\\nthemselves well. That all implies that what’s most important to being strong is\\nhow we act with ourselves.\\nTHE WAR WITH OURSELVES: THE ENEMY IS US\\nOur greatest war is with ourselves because we have the most control over how\\nstrong or weak we are. Because it is pretty clear what makes countries strong and\\nweak, and because these strengths and weaknesses are measurable, it is easy to see\\nhow each country is doing. These factors were laid out in the \\x00rst and second\\nchapters and measured by 18 determinants. I will brie\\x00y review them here, andin the next and \\x00nal part, I will show these determinants for most countries and\\nwill explore the leading indicators of them so that we can make projections of\\nwhat’s to come.\\nBefore we do that, let’s review the speci\\x00c items that help make a great\\nempire. They are…\\n… leadership that is strong enough and capable enough to provide\\nthe essential ingredients for success, which include…\\n… strong education. By strong education I don’t just mean teaching\\nknowledge and skills; I also mean teaching…\\n… strong character, civility, and a strong work ethic, which are\\ntypically taught in the family as well as in school. These lead to improved\\ncivility that is re\\x00ected in factors such as…\\n… low corruption and high respect for rules, such as the rule of law.\\n… People being able to work well together, united behind a\\ncommon view of how they should be together, is also important.\\nWhen people have knowledge, skills, good character, and the civility to\\nbehave and work well together, and there is…\\n… a good system for allocating resources, which is signi\\x00cantly\\nimproved by…\\n… being open to the best global thinking, the country has the most\\nimportant ingredients in order to succeed. That leads to it gaining…\\n… greater competitiveness in global markets, which brings in revenues\\nthat are greater than expenses, which leads the country to have…… strong income growth, which allows it to make…\\n… increased investments to improve infrastructure, education, and\\nresearch and development, which lead it to have…\\n… rapidly increasing productivity (more valuable output per hour\\nworked). Increasing productivity is what increases wealth and productive\\ncapabilities. When the country achieves higher productivity levels, it can\\nbecome productive inventors in…\\n… new technologies. These new technologies are valuable for both\\ncommerce and the military. As the country becomes more competitive in\\nthese ways, naturally it gains…\\n… a rising and signi\\x00cant share of world trade, which requires it to\\nhave…\\n… a strong military to protect its trade routes and to in\\x00uence those\\nwho are important to them outside their borders. In becoming\\neconomically preeminent the country develops…\\n… strong and widely used currency, equity, and credit markets.\\nNaturally those dominant in trade and capital \\x00ows have their currency\\nused much more as the preferred global medium of exchange and the\\npreferred storehold of wealth, which leads to their currency becoming a\\nreserve currency and the building of…\\n… at least one of the world’s leading \\x00nancial centers for attracting\\nand distributing capital and expanding their trade globally.\\nWhatever makes these measures go up is good and whatever makes\\nthem go down is bad. For this reason it is wise for citizens of all countriesto ask themselves how well they collectively and their leaders are doing at\\nmaking the lines in these measures go up. I also hope that they will\\nremember the cause/e\\x00ect relationships, avoiding the excesses and\\ndivisions that lead to declines.\\nAs for the case at hand, the internal wars and challenges in both\\nChina and the US are more important and bigger than external wars and\\nchallenges. These include political wars within the leadership of the country\\nand at all levels of government, wars between di\\x00erent factions (e.g., the rich and\\nthe poor, the rural and the urban, conservatives and progressives, ethnic groups,\\netc.), demographic changes, climate change, etc. Fortunately, the most\\nimportant of these forces are within our control and are measurable, which\\nallows us to see how we are doing and, if we’re not doing well, to make changes\\nso these things move in the right directions. By and large we will get what we\\ndeserve. As Churchill said to the British people, “Deserve Victory!”\\n1 Decoupling, while required given the circumstances, will be di\\x00cult and will lead to signi\\x00cantly reduced\\ne\\x00ciency. China’s main program for building self-su\\x00ciency goes under the name of “dual circulation.”\\nOne knowledgeable party described it as a compartmented rather than a broad-based decoupling, which\\nmakes sense to me.\\n2 One in \\x00ve North America-based companies in a 2019 CNBC Global CFO Council survey claimed to\\nhave had intellectual property stolen by Chinese companies.\\n3 It is widely recognized that “regime change” has been commonly employed by the United States for\\nmanaging its world order.\\n4 This statement was made in connection with the Taiwan reuni\\x00cation issue.\\n5 The shares of dollar-denominated debt are large in relation to a) the percentage of asset allocations that\\ninternational investors would hold to balance their portfolios well, b) the sizes of reserve currency holdings\\nthat are appropriate to meet trade and capital \\x00ow funding needs, and c) the size and importance of the US\\neconomy relative to other economies. Dollar-denominated debt is now disproportionately large because the\\ndollar is the world’s leading reserve currency, which means it is perceived as a safer asset than it really is, and\\nbecause dollar borrowings have been disproportionately large. Now most of those who are responsible for\\ndetermining what the shares of their holdings should be in di\\x00erent markets are not inclined to increase the\\nshares in line with the greater amounts of US bonds to be sold and are in fact considering reducing their\\nshares held in US debt, which, if it happens, will require larger purchases by the Federal Reserve.\\n6 This data is adjusted for purchasing power parity.7 In fact, it is a challenge for the Chinese to deal with the lack of continuity of policies and directions in the\\nUS arising from seemingly whimsical shifts in what matters to the American public as expressed in whom\\nthey choose to represent them.PART III\\nTHE FUTURECHAPTER 14\\nTHE FUTURE\\n“He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass” is a\\nmarket adage I learned when I was about 14. Since I’ve personally\\nexperienced it to be true, it has a\\x00ected how I look at both the future\\nand the past. I have learned to look at the past 1) to determine what’s\\nlikely to happen and 2) to protect myself and others I am responsible for\\nagainst the possibility I am wrong or missing something important.\\nWhile you and I and others can argue about the patterns and cause/e\\x00ect\\nrelationships described in this book, if you are reading this for practical\\npurposes rather than just casual interest, then you, like me, need to do\\nthose two things well.\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to share my thoughts about how I\\napproach the future. While what I don’t know about the future is\\nprobably much more than what I do know, what I do know is also a lot.\\nDealing with the future is all about 1) perceiving and adapting to what is\\nhappening, even if it can’t be anticipated; 2) coming up with\\nprobabilities for what might happen; and 3) knowing enough about\\nwhat might happen to protect oneself against the unacceptable, even if\\none can’t do that perfectly.\\nKnowing how things have changed in the past leads me to consider the\\npossibility that something similar might happen in the future. That is a big\\nadvantage relative to being unaware. For example, there are numerous examples\\nin history of revolutions, wars, and acts of nature leading to violent events in\\nwhich virtually all wealth is wiped out or con\\x00scated. Knowing this, I amconstantly looking for leading indicators of the same things happening again,\\nand having leading indicators of these things, even if they aren’t perfect, puts me\\nin a better position to protect myself than remaining blissfully unaware and\\nunprepared for what might happen.\\nWhile that example is of a worst-case scenario, being unaware of best-case\\nscenarios can be equally bad. I remember very well how my dad and his friends\\nfailed to take advantage of the boom that followed the Great Depression and\\nWorld War II, as their mindsets had been formed by those awful eras. In playing\\nthe game of life it pays to do one’s best to understand how the world works,\\nimagine the full range of possibilities (including their risks and rewards), and\\nknow how to spread one’s bets around well.\\nWhile I will pass along my thinking, please remember that everything I say is\\ndebatable; the purpose of this whole project is to improve my assessed\\nprobabilities of being right. As such, it is a work in progress, and I hope you will\\njoin me in evolving it. To that end, I plan to continually update my\\nunderstandings of these patterns and lessons at economicprinciples.org, where\\nwe can interact to re\\x00ne the picture.\\nMY APPROACH\\nTo quickly review, my approach is based on my ideas about a) evolution,\\nwhich causes changes over time, generally toward improvement, such as\\nincreasing productivity, b) cycles, which cause rhythmic ups and downs\\nin the economy (like debt bubbles and busts) and bumps along the way\\n(non-rhythmic ups and downs, like acts of nature), and c) indicators that\\ncan help us see where we are in the cycles and what might come next. I\\nwill brie\\x00y recap my thoughts on each.\\nEVOLUTIONThe most important things evolve in ways that are easy to see and\\nextrapolate forward, so it’s not di\\x00cult to get a pretty good sense of roughly\\nwhere they are likely to be in the future, so long as a once-in-500-years-type game\\nchanger doesn’t come along. The following charts tell the story about\\npopulation, life expectancy, and prosperity.\\nLet’s start with world population. The chart on the left starts at 1500 and the\\none on the right starts at 1900. I show them both because I want you to see how\\ndi\\x00erent one’s perspective would be if one were looking back 100 years from\\n1900 versus 100 years from today. Note how dramatically the population grew\\nin the 20th century. Also note that the major historical events mentioned in this\\nbook—including the Great Depression, the two World Wars, and any number of\\nnatural catastrophes—had no visible e\\x00ect on the larger evolutionary trend.\\nThe next two charts show the population growth rate. Notice the big ups\\nand downs that don’t show up in the prior charts because they are so minor in\\ncomparison to the long-term trend. If we had personally experienced any of this\\nvolatility, it would have felt like a life or death experience (which it very much\\nwas).The next two charts show a similar picture for life expectancy. There are a lot\\nmore wiggles in these charts than in the previous ones because average life\\nexpectancy changes more when there are big events like wars and pandemics (I\\nwill show you what those big killers were and where they occurred at\\neconomicprinciples.org). Note how life expectancy stayed roughly the same\\n(about 25–30 years) for about 350 years and then accelerated starting around\\n1900, when there were big improvements in infant mortality rates and several\\nmedical advances, like antibiotics.\\n1\\nNow let’s look at economic prosperity as measured by real (i.e., in\\x00ation-\\nadjusted) GDP. The \\x00rst chart shows a similarly, sweeping picture: the real value\\nof what was produced per person grew slowly until the 19th century and then\\naccelerated, with that broad evolutionary trend dominant relative to the wobbles\\nwithin it.\\nThe next chart shows real wealth per capita since 1900. From 1900 until\\n1945, there was no increase to speak of as that was the late-cycle transition phasefrom the 19th century boom to the new world order in 1945. Peace and\\nprosperity followed the creation of the new world order, and the uptrend was\\nstrong and pretty steady (averaging 4 percent per year), even though the\\nmovements around it felt big when we went through them.\\nWith these evolutions in mind, let’s start looking toward the future.\\nIf we look back carefully to see how the present was created, we can see that\\nthese evolutionary advances didn’t just happen on their own: every day, there\\nwere events that a\\x00ected the present while people’s actions shaped them. At the\\nsame time, we know that we never could have anticipated them individually—if\\nwe had tried to predict each of the speci\\x00c wars, droughts, pandemics,\\ninventions, prosperous periods, declines, etc., we would have failed. But even\\nwithout knowing about any of those speci\\x00c developments, we could have\\npretty con\\x00dently said that advances would occur that would enable\\nsigni\\x00cantly larger populations to live signi\\x00cantly longer while enjoying\\nsigni\\x00cantly higher standards of living because of the evolution that has already\\noccurred, and that we have every reason to expect to continue to occur, from\\nhumanity’s inventiveness. We could have also con\\x00dently asserted that there\\nwould be booms and busts, feasts and famines, and periods of great health and\\ndisease along the way.\\nBased just on what happened in the past 100 years, one might conclude that\\none can get pretty good estimates just by extrapolating the past forward. As an\\nexample, by simply extrapolating the past 100 years, it would be reasonable to\\nexpect that in the next 10 years the world’s population will be around 10–15\\npercent higher than it is today, the output per person will be about 20 percenthigher, the wealth per person will be 30 percent higher, and the average life\\nexpectancy will be 7.5 percent higher, give or take a bit. It would be reasonable\\nto expect that in the next 20 years they will be up 25–30 percent, 45 percent, 70\\npercent, and around 15 percent, respectively, without knowing speci\\x00cally how\\nthat will happen.\\nThat simple, not-especially-thoughtful analysis paints a picture that probably\\nwon’t be far o\\x00—but it could be. It is easy to paint this picture in much greater\\ndetail by looking at the same stats for each country and each sub-group within a\\ncountry in this way. Processing all of this information is pretty complicated for\\nthe human mind alone, but not for a good human mind working with a\\ncomputer.\\nBut we can see that a picture drawn from pure extrapolation is not good\\nenough. For example, standing in 1750, it would have been reasonable to believe\\nthat it was a timeless and universal truth that monarchies and landowning\\nnobles overseeing peasants with the help of soldiers would be the governance\\nsystem in the future, that agricultural land would continue to be the most\\nimportant money-earning asset, that per capita incomes would grow at only\\naround half a percent per year, and that life expectancy would remain steady at\\nabout 30 years. That was how it had always been. You would not have imagined\\ncapitalism and democracy as we now know it, let alone that there would be a\\nUnited States and that it would be the leading world power.\\nThe big curveballs come when a few really big things cause a paradigm shift\\nthat alters the evolutionary rates of change. The paradigm shifts that came in the\\nearly 19th century arose from the con\\x00uence of the invention of modern tools of\\n\\x00nance, machines that could do the work of people, the development of more\\ninclusive societies that broadened opportunities to be inventive and productive,\\nthe increased use of books and libraries so knowledge could be more broadly\\nshared, and the application of the scienti\\x00c method. While these things couldn’t\\nbe anticipated, they could have been perceived, understood, and adapted to.\\nThat’s why \\n while extrapolating the past is gener ally a reasonable thing to do, also be\\nprepar ed to be surprised because the futur e will be much diff erent than y ou expect it t o be.\\nThroughout my roughly 50 years of investing, I have seen a number of well-\\nestablished beliefs based on both what happened before and what seemed logicalat the time be proven wrong (to choose a recent example, the belief that bond\\nyields can’t go negative). The greatest recent disruptor of well-established beliefs\\nwas the Digital Revolution. Through these experiences and observations I\\nlearned that \\n identifying , understanding, and adapting to paradigm shifts is essential,\\neven if one can’t anticipate them—though trying to anticipate them with good indicat ors that\\nhelp is impor tant too. Having good indicators can also help you tell when what\\nlooks like a paradigm shift is only a passing fad, which is just as important.\\nCYCLES AND BUMPS ALONG THE WAY\\nCycles and bumps were covered comprehensively in prior chapters, but\\nthey warrant re\\x00ection now that we are shifting our attention from the\\npast to the future.\\nThough they barely register when compared to the mega-macro\\npicture, they can damage and kill large numbers of people. Just look at\\nthe following charts that show depressions, declines in wealth, deaths in\\nwars, and deaths via pandemics over the past 500 years to gain some\\nperspective about them. Those bad times were even worse than they look\\nbecause the charts capture them in terms of averages; as such they understate the\\nseverity of the experience for the people who were most directly a\\x00ected. Most\\npeople don’t think about this darker picture. They look at the positive post-\\n1945 trends and extrapolate them forward. It’s up to you to decide if you’re in\\nthat camp too. As for me, seeing that these big, deadly things have happened in\\nthe past leads me to distrust the belief that they won’t happen again. Unless and\\nuntil someone shows me better evidence that they won’t happen again than the\\nsimple fact that they haven’t happened yet, I am going to assume they will and\\ntry to protect myself from their consequences.One of the overarching principles I derived from my research and my 50-plus\\nyears of investing experience is \\n in the mark ets and in life, to be succes sful one should\\nbet on the upside that comes from a) evolution that leads to productivity impr ovements, but\\nnot so aggr essiv ely that b) cycles and bumps along the way knock you out of the game.  In\\nother words, betting on things being better—e.g., real earnings being greater—is\\npretty much a sure bet. But betting too much on that so that a bump along the\\nway can ruin you is bad. That’s why having quality indicators helps a lot.\\nQUALITY INDICATORS\\nBecause everything that happens is the result of events that have\\nhappened before, I have some pretty good and logical, though imperfect,\\nleading and coincident indicators of important changes. Some can be\\nquanti\\x00ed, while others can’t be.\\nAs previously explained, I found 18 determinants that explain most of\\nthe conditions and changes in wealth and power both within and\\nbetween nations. I will soon show you the readout of all of these 18\\ndeterminants for each of the 11 major powers I’m following in this book(more detail on the top 20 countries is shown at economicprinciples.org).\\nBut \\x00rst I want to share some big-picture thoughts about the \\x00ve\\ndeterminants that have had the biggest impacts in the past and that I\\nbelieve will have the biggest impacts on what happens in the years ahead:\\ninnovation, the debt/money/capital market cycle, the internal order and\\ndisorder cycle, the external order and disorder cycle, and acts of nature.\\nWhen looking at the charts, remember that in some cases the determinants rise\\nand fall together because they are mutually reinforcing, while in others one\\ncountry’s gains are at the expense of another’s. For example, inventing new\\ntechnologies raises all of humanity’s living standards, but it puts the countries\\nthat are better at inventing in a superior position. Rising levels of military\\nstrength are clearly less bene\\x00cial for humanity, as they bene\\x00t some countries at\\nthe expense of others.\\nHUMANITY’S INVENTIVENESS\\nAs previously discussed, innovation and inventiveness are clearly the\\nmost powerful determinant of a country’s conditions.\\nThink about all the things that we can’t imagine not having that were\\ninvented or discovered in just the last 150 years. Before we had them, nobody\\ncould have imagined them—e.g., the telephone (1876), the electric light bulb\\n(1879), the internal combustion powered vehicle (1885), the radio (1895),\\nmovies (1895), the airplane (1903), television (1926), antibiotics (1928), the\\ncomputer (1939), nuclear weapons (1945), nuclear power plants (1951), GPS\\n(1973), digital cameras (1975), online shopping (1979), the internet (1983),\\nonline search (1990), online banking (1995), social media (1997), Wi-Fi (1998),\\nthe iPhone (2007), CRISPR gene editing (2012), etc., etc., etc. Progress unfolds\\nin big and steady ways to shape the future but does so through speci\\x00c\\nbreakthroughs that we can’t imagine. That is what evolution in technologies and\\ntechniques looks like. Evolution in most everything else—approaches to life,\\ndomestic and international politics, etc.—happens in a similar way.I believe that humanity’s evolution through its inventiveness is\\naccelerating and that most people will bene\\x00t from it. That is because the\\nmost signi\\x00cant inventions we are now seeing, and that we know we will see\\nmany more of, improve the quality and quantity of all thinking. These\\ninventions are coming in the forms of advances in computers, AI, and other\\nthinking-related technologies. Because they can be applied to many domains of\\nhuman activity and decision making, it seems obvious to me that the rate of\\ninvention and improvement in most areas will accelerate at an even faster pace,\\nrapidly raising productivity and living standards.\\nHumans now have computers to help them think in ways in which they are\\ncomparatively handicapped (e.g., computers have far more memory than the\\nhuman brain and it is readily accessible, they can process more data at a\\nfantastically faster rate, and they do not make emotional mistakes); at the same\\ntime, humans can help computers get past their inherent limitations (e.g., their\\ncomplete absence of imagination, intuition, common sense, value judgements,\\nand emotional intelligence). This collaboration between humans and computers\\nwill increase both the quantity and quality of thinking,2 portending radical\\nimprovements in almost every area of life. I know this because I have experienced\\nit, and I can already see some of these improvements on the horizon.\\nIn other words, the abilities of both computers and humans will\\nimprove at an increasing pace. Perhaps most importantly, advances in\\nand the wider use of quantum computing with AI will lead to\\nunimaginable advances in rates of learning and improvement and\\nchanges in global wealth and power. These changes will occur in varying\\ndegrees in the next \\x00ve to 20 years, but I believe they will add up to the\\ngreatest shift in wealth and power that the world has ever seen.\\nQuantum computing with AI will be to traditional computing what the\\ncomputer was to the abacus, providing humanity with vastly more power\\nto see, understand, and shape things. That makes me long-term very\\noptimistic and eager to bet on great new discoveries.\\nEven without the boosts from quantum computing, I’d expect the human\\nlifespan to increase by a lot over the next two decades (by 20–25 percent or\\nmore), for reasons we can see and for many more reasons that we can’t yet see. Afew inventions that are already on the horizon are AI and robotics in healthcare,\\nhealth monitoring, and advice-providing wearables; advances in and the practical\\nuse of genome sequencing and gene editing; mRNA improvements in vaccines;\\nand breakthroughs in nutrition and drugs. And if the past is any guide (and it is)\\nthere will be many more inventions that we can’t yet fathom.\\nNaturally I can’t help but imagine the implications for investing. All else\\nbeing equal, equities in the companies making new inventions and the\\ncompanies that bene\\x00t from them are the right ones to own if you want to bet\\non evolution happening, but whether the returns to investors match the\\nperformance of the innovations depends on how governments decide to divide\\nthe pro\\x00ts of productivity. If the world is \\x00nancially overextended and has large\\nwealth gaps, this creates headwinds. Also, price matters. It’s possible to invest in\\ngreat companies and lose money because they are so expensive and invest in bad\\ncompanies and make money because they are so cheap. Finally, and as with\\neverything else, there are downsides. Humanity’s inventiveness and the new\\ntechnologies it produces can have bad as well as good e\\x00ects. Advances in\\ntechnologies for in\\x00icting harm will certainly occur alongside advances in\\nmedical care. So my view is that inventiveness and increases in living\\nstandards will probably get a lot better a lot faster—if humanity doesn’t\\nkill itself \\x00rst.\\nThe next chart shows our latest reading on the inventiveness, technological\\nadvancement, and entrepreneurship we see in major countries. The arrows on\\nthe top of the bars show whether the trend in each country’s standing has been\\nup, sideways, or down. This gauge gives about half its weight to 1) a\\ncombination of external rankings and measures of innovation per capita (to help\\ncapture how widespread innovation is in the economy) and half to 2) the\\ncountry’s absolute share of key innovation metrics (e.g., researchers, R&D\\nspending, patents, Nobel Prizes, and venture capital funding). Like all my\\ngauges, it is approximately right but not perfectly right, so it’s meant to be\\nbroadly indicative. As shown, the US is at the top of these measures with a\\nmarginal lead over China, which ranks second (primarily due to the US’s\\nshare of global research spending, researchers, and its lead in other areas\\nsuch as venture capital funding). But the US’s position is steady, whileChina’s position in the standings is rising fast. Remember that whoever\\nwins the technology war usually wins the economic and military wars.\\nFor more detail on all the gauges shown in this chapter, please refer to the end of\\nthis chapter, where you can read a short description of each.\\n3\\nTHE DEBT/MONEY/CAPITAL\\nMARKET/ECONOMIC CYCLE\\nAs I explained earlier, this cycle is the biggest driver of the ups and downs in\\neconomies that have big implications for internal and external politics and wars,\\nso knowing where countries are in this cycle is essential to anticipating what’s\\nlikely to come next.\\nBased on my readings of history, my readings of existing conditions,\\nand my understanding of how the economic machine works, the\\npromises that are denominated in the world’s reserve currencies, most\\nimportantly the dollar, are too large and growing too fast to be paid in\\nhard money. In other words, the debt that is denominated in these\\ncurrencies is an overhang, so money will probably be printed to service\\ndebts and debt growth4 and interest rates will probably be held below\\nin\\x00ation and economic/income growth rates. This re\\x00ects the fact that\\nthe major reserve currency countries are late in their debt/money/capital\\nmarket/economic cycles and that wealth will probably be increasingly\\nredistributed from those who have a lot of it to those who don’t haveenough of it in one way or another. The extent to which these things will\\nbe true will vary from country to country, though it will likely be\\nworldwide.\\nFor that reason, the biggest risk in the long run is the “currency value\\nof money” risk, which most people don’t pay enough attention to. I hope\\nChapter 4 helps people understand and deal with it better.\\nTo be clear, because the reserve currency countries that are running big\\nde\\x00cits have their de\\x00cits and debts denominated in their own currencies, their\\nability to print the money to service the debts transfers the risks from them as\\ndebtors to those who are holding the debt as creditors. So, the big risk is not\\nthat those big debtors will default; it is that creditors will hold assets\\nthat will be devalued—i.e., that the returns from holding debt assets will\\nbe less than the in\\x00ation rate. I believe a great transfer of wealth from\\ncreditors to debtors (as happened in the biblical years of Jubilee, as explained in\\nChapter 3) is coming for the same reasons it has always come in the past.\\nWhat does that mean for the dollar (most importantly) and the other\\nmore minor reserve currencies? Will they decline and others replace them?\\nMost probably they will decline analogously to past reserve currency\\ndeclines: slowly for a long time and then very quickly. As we saw in those\\ncases, the pace of reserve currency decline signi\\x00cantly lags the pace of the\\ndeclines in other measures of strength. Reserve currencies tend to live on long\\nafter their fundamentals cease to justify their prominence because they become\\ndeeply entrenched in the ways things are done and there is a strong inclination to\\nkeep them. Then they abruptly plunge when it becomes clear that the\\nfundamentals behind the currency make holding debt in it a bad deal.\\nThe fall happens fast because the currency’s rate of decline outpaces the\\ninterest rate paid to the holders of the debt; the net losses lead to selling, which\\ncauses more losses, so the spiral becomes self-reinforcing. The Dutch guilder and\\nthe British pound both plunged in this way due to geopolitical crises/defeats\\nhappening when they had large debts. Those events made it clear to creditors\\nthat their fundamentals were weaker than they had assumed and the interest rate\\ncouldn’t compensate for the decline.While I have very good indicators to identify this kind of decline happening\\nas it happens, and some pretty good leading indicators that indicate when it will\\nhappen in the short term, my long-term leading indicators are only so-so for\\ntiming purposes. That is because they are \\x00nancial and based on supply and\\ndemand. It is pretty easy to assess the \\x00nancial conditions of countries in the\\nsame ways that one assesses the \\x00nancial conditions of people and companies (by\\nchecking whether they are running surpluses or de\\x00cits and have more assets\\nthan liabilities, and \\x00nding out if their debts are in their own or foreign\\ncurrencies and who is funding them and why). Because these are all long-term\\ndrivers, it is also pretty easy to see which countries and currencies are vulnerable.\\nBut anticipating exactly when the big fall will happen is di\\x00cult.\\nThe debt burden gauge shown next is based on a combination of a)\\ndebt levels relative to asset levels, b) the sizes of external and internal\\nsurpluses and de\\x00cits, c) the sizes of debt service costs relative to GDP, d)\\nthe amount of debt in a country’s own currency versus foreign currency,\\ne) the amount of debt held by its own citizens versus foreigners, and f) its\\ncredit rating. I composed it this way because this way has proven to be the\\nmost reliable way we have of foreshadowing declines in the real value of money\\nand the debt assets that are promises to receive money, whether they come in the\\nform of debt defaults that result from not creating enough money and credit to\\nsatisfy excessive debt needs or devaluations that come from creating more than\\nenough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs. I constructed this index\\nto exclude reserve currency status so that I can see the exposure a country would\\nhave if it lost its reserve currency status. Reserve currency status is shown in the\\nchart that follows.\\nTogether these charts paint a pretty clear picture. For example, while the US’s\\ndebt burdens are high, its debt is denominated in dollars, the world’s\\nleading reserve currency, so it has the ability to print money to service its\\ndebts. This reduces its risk of default but increases its devaluation risk.\\nAs you can see, if the US lost its reserve currency status, it would be in\\nserious \\x00nancial trouble. Russia and Germany rank strongest on the debt\\nburden gauge because they are the least indebted. Russia has no reserve currency\\nstatus, and Germany has a fair amount because it uses the euro, now the secondmost important reserve currency. China is in the middle of the rankings on the\\ndebt burden gauge because its debts are moderately high, mostly in its own\\ncurrency, and mostly held by the Chinese. Its reserve currency status is emerging.\\n5\\nTHE INTERNAL ORDER AND DISORDER CYCLE\\nLuo Guanzhong’s classic book Romance of the Three Kingdoms begins: “The\\nempire long divided must unite and long united must divide. Thus it\\nhas ever been.” That has been true of China and most other places, and it is\\nlikely to continue, so it’s a good principle. I explained the big cycle of internal\\norder and disorder in Chapter 5, so I won’t reiterate it here other than to remind\\nyou of a key principle: \\n peace is pr oﬁtable and war is costly .\\nThat holds both within countries and between them. When parties cooperate\\nand compete well, and don’t waste resources on \\x00ghting, productivity and living\\nstandards rise. When they \\x00ght, they waste resources (sometimes including\\nlives), they destroy more than they produce, and living standards fall. It is for thisreason that the degree of con\\x00ict within a country is such an important\\nindicator.\\nAs of this writing there are varying amounts of con\\x00ict going on\\nwithin di\\x00erent countries, as shown in the next chart. Internal con\\x00ict is\\nespecially high in the United States, which appears to be in Stage 5 of the\\ncycle (when there are bad \\x00nancial conditions and intense con\\x00ict), while\\nChina appears to be in Stage 3 (when there is peace and prosperity).\\nChanges to this measure can happen quickly—e.g., the changes that\\nproduced the Arab Spring, the con\\x00icts in Hong Kong, internal wars in Syria\\nand Afghanistan, recent big protests in Peru and Chile, etc.—leading to\\nrevolutionary changes in their internal orders. Because I expect that these\\nreadings will be out of date by the time this book is in your hands, I will\\nupdate them regularly at economicprinciples.org.\\nAt the end of the day, \\n power rules and tests of power are the ways one learns who\\nrules.  Sometimes that happens within a framework of rules that are respected. In\\nthose cases, \\x00ghts for power occur in a mutually agreed-upon and productive\\nway that supports the internal order. But they can also happen in unproductive,\\nno-holds-barred ways that can lead to the violent disruption of both the\\nleadership and the internal order. While I think that the odds of the US\\ndevolving into a Stage 6 (civil-war-type) dynamic within the next 10\\nyears are only around 30 percent, that is a dangerously high risk that\\nmust be protected against and watched closely via my coincident and\\nleading indicators.All internal orders, even those that are not democratic, have rules about how\\ndecisions are made and how power is gained and shared. Because one can usually\\nsee how well these governance rules are respected or ignored, it is pretty easy to\\nsee when an internal order is being threatened by an emerging civil war. For\\nexample, when close elections are adjudicated and the losers respect the\\ndecisions, it is clear that the order is respected. When power is fought over and\\ngrabbed, that clearly signals the signi\\x00cant risk of a revolutionary change with all\\nits attendant disorder.\\nThere have been signs of that happening in the US, with some people\\ncontesting the validity of elections and expressing a willingness to \\x00ght for their\\naims. This bears watching.\\nThere is also an exceptional amount of polarization in the US right\\nnow, as re\\x00ected in the stats. Survey data about the sentiments of the voters\\npaints a picture of polarization and intransigence. For example, in a 2019 Pew\\nsurvey 55 percent of Republicans and 47 percent of Democrats viewed the other\\nas more immoral than other Americans, and 61 percent of Republicans and 54\\npercent of Democrats said that those of the other party don’t share their values.\\nWhen asked whether they had warm or cold feelings to those of the other party,\\n79 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans said they had “cold” or\\n“very cold” feelings for members of the other party (of that, 57 percent of\\nDemocrats and 60 percent of Republicans selected “very cold”). Another study\\nreported that 80 percent of Democrats think that the Republican Party has been\\ntaken over by racists and 82 percent of Republicans think that the Democratic\\nParty has been taken over by socialists. A 2010 study showed that nearly half of\\nRepublican parents and a third of Democratic parents would be displeased if\\ntheir child married someone from the other political party. That compares with\\nabout 5 percent for both parties in 1960. One recent survey showed that 15\\npercent of Republicans and 20 percent of Democrats thought the country\\nwould be better o\\x00 if large numbers of the other side “just died.”\\nVery important and very telling political con\\x00icts and changes lie ahead in the\\nnext few years. They will be indicative of what the next stage in the increasingly\\ndisorderly internal orders will be like in the major countries, especially in the US.\\nWhile the United States looks like it is in the precarious Stage 5 of thecycle, it also has the longest-lasting and most widely admired internal\\norder (its constitutional system). As explained in Chapter 5, this makes it less\\nlikely that it will be abandoned, but more traumatic if it is. The most reliable\\nsigns of an escalation to civil war are 1) the rules being disregarded, 2) both sides\\nemotionally attacking each other, and 3) blood being spilled. While Stage 6 is the\\nmost dysfunctional and harmful stage, increasing amounts of dysfunction\\nhappen in the stages leading up to it. These sorts of con\\x00icts can exist\\nthroughout society, not just in government.\\nShown next is how the con\\x00ict gauge has changed for the US since the late\\n1700s, including the breakdowns between the two sub-gauges. What these\\ncharts re\\x00ect is that the overall level of con\\x00ict within the United States is\\nnow as high as it’s been since the civil rights and Vietnam War protests\\nof the late 1960s, but meaningfully less than it was then. The “internal\\nstrife” index (which mostly re\\x00ects demonstrations in the streets) is\\nmoderately high, and the “political con\\x00ict” index is the highest it’s been\\nsince the early 1920s, when a deep post-war recession and massive labor\\nunrest6 contributed to big electoral losses for the Democrats.\\nNote that the comparable periods before then were the 1900s–1910s (which\\nsaw a backlash against the “robber barons,” the rise of the Progressive\\nmovement, and eventually World War I), and the 1860s, when economic and\\nvalues con\\x00icts led to civil war. The risks are high, but not unprecedentedly\\nso. Still, the picture should be scary for Americans and scary for the world\\nbecause the world’s leading power is on the brink and could tip one way or the\\nother. Fractured conditions within the US are now contributing to instability in\\nother parts of the world. Any worsening would be at least as disruptive as those\\npast periods.\\nSo what does this all mean for the US? As I explained in Chapter 11, our\\nmeasures suggest that it is very roughly 70 percent through its big cycle. Can it\\nslow or reverse its relative decline? History shows us that reversing a decline\\nis very di\\x00cult because it requires undoing so many things that have\\nalready been done. For example, if one’s spending is greater than one’s\\nearnings and one’s liabilities are greater than one’s assets, those\\ncircumstances can only be reversed by working harder or consuming less.\\nThe question is whether we Americans can face our challenges honestly\\nand adapt and change to meet them. For example, while the capitalist pro\\x00t-\\nmaking system allocates resources relatively e\\x00ciently, Americans now need to\\nask themselves: “Who is it optimizing these e\\x00ciencies for?” “What should be\\ndone if the bene\\x00ts are not broad-based?” “Will we modify capitalism so that it\\nboth increases the size of the pie (by increasing productivity) and divides it\\nwell?” These questions are especially important to answer in an era when, thanks\\nto new technologies, employing people will increasingly become unpro\\x00table,\\nine\\x00cient, and uncompetitive. “Should we, or should we not, invest in people to\\nmake them productive, even when it’s uneconomic to do so?” “What if our\\ninternational competitors choose robots over people?” These and so many more\\nimportant, di\\x00cult questions come to mind. But while we can’t know for\\ncertain whether the splits and con\\x00icts in the US will increase or reverse,\\nwe do know that the long-term momentum is toward increasing division\\nand this is a serious risk. The fact that the US is simultaneously deeply\\nindebted, its international standing is weakening, and it is experiencing\\nserious con\\x00ict should be concerning both to Americans and to non-Americans who depend on them. At the same time, in its 245-year history the\\nUS has shown a great capacity to bend without breaking. The greatest challenges\\nit faces are internal ones: can it remain strong and united, or will it\\ncontinue to allow division and internal struggles to lead to decline?\\nTHE EXTERNAL ORDER AND DISORDER CYCLE\\n All empir es decline and new ones rise to replace them.  Understanding when that\\nchange might happen requires watching all of the indicators and tracking the\\nrelative conditions of countries. Remember from earlier in the book that there\\nare \\x00ve major types of wars that have existed throughout history: 1)\\ntrade/economic wars, 2) technology wars, 3) capital wars, 4) geopolitical wars,\\nand 5) military wars. The external con\\x00ict gauge shown here measures the levels\\nof economic, political/cultural, and military con\\x00ict between pairs of major\\ncountries. As shown, the greatest con\\x00ict is between the US and China, the two\\ngreatest powers in the world that have comparable amounts of power—mo re\\nthan enough to make a war between them the most devastating in history.\\nThe amount of this con\\x00ict is 1 standard deviation above normal,\\nwhich is pretty severe in relation to past con\\x00icts between countries.\\nThis next chart shows my index of con\\x00ict just between the US and\\nChina since 1970.Based on what we have been seeing, the United States and China are clearly in\\nfour types of war (trade/economic war, technology war, capital war, and\\ngeopolitical war), though not intensely but they are intensifying. They are not\\nyet in the \\x00fth type of war (military war). As shown in the previous cases, in\\nparticular the 1930–1945 case, these four types of wars precede military wars by\\nabout \\x00ve to 10 years. Though the risks of military war seem relatively low, they\\nare increasing.\\nLooking back over the last 500 years, one can see that military wars between\\nmajor empires started on average about once every 10 years, give or take a couple\\nof years, and it has been about 75 years since the last really big one (World War\\nII). Since 1500, major powers have been at war a little bit more than half the\\ntime.7 From that perspective, the odds of a big military war in the next 10 years\\nare about 50/50, but of course that’s simple minded. Let’s look at the picture a\\nbit more carefully.\\nThe following chart shows the current individual readings of my\\nmilitary strength gauge. While overall these readings make sense—the\\nUS is the most powerful by most measures, China is the next most\\npowerful, Russia comes next, etc.—they don’t capture the important\\nrealities beneath these summary numbers. For example, they don’t show\\nthat some countries are as powerful as or more powerful than the United\\nStates in speci\\x00c geographic areas (e.g., right around China) and in some\\ntypes of warfare (e.g., space, cyber, etc.) Also, they don’t consider the\\ne\\x00ects of military cooperation and alliances (e.g., China and Russia), and\\nthey can’t account for what unknown military abilities countries may\\nhave. For me, the big headline is that there are lots of ways thesecountries can hurt or destroy each other in the most contested\\ngeographic areas.\\nHistory shows that wars are terribly costly in lives and money, and the\\ncapacity to in\\x00ict harm has advanced exponentially since nuclear weapons were\\ndeveloped and used in World War II. I am unable to imagine what the next\\nmilitary war would look like. I have also seen that those who are most informed\\non both sides are not fully informed because a lot is unknown and because\\nmilitary wars always transpire in unexpected ways. For those reasons, it is\\nimpossible to con\\x00dently say who the winners and losers in the next big\\nwar would be. We also know from logic and from studying history that the\\nlosers of really big wars are completely wiped out and the winners lose too, as\\nthey su\\x00er severe consequences and end up with big debts. What that means for\\neconomies and markets was explained earlier in the book, but in a word, it is\\ndevastating.\\nStudents of history know that the doctrine of mutually assured destruction\\nprevented the US and the USSR from entering a hot war before the Soviet\\nEmpire fell, mostly due to the failure to grow its other strengths in the face of big\\nmilitary spending. China is roughly comparable in power to the United States in\\nthe most important ways, and it is on its way to becoming more powerful in\\nmany ways. China won’t be as easy to defeat in any of the \\x00ve types of war as the\\nUSSR was, and the USSR wasn’t easy to defeat. That means the wars are likely\\nto intensify and increasingly favor China, especially if the US doesn’t turn\\naround the other fundamental underpinnings of strength that are highlighted inthis chapter. However, it seems like it will be a long time before China can win a\\nwar without having the war lead to its own destruction as well.\\nSo, in summary, my computer and I working together now believe that\\nbecause for the foreseeable future China and the US will be powerful\\nenough to in\\x00ict unacceptable harm on each other the prospect of\\nmutually assured destruction should prevent military war, though there\\nalmost certainly will be dangerous skirmishes. I expect this to be true\\nunless some unexpected technological breakthrough, like dramatic\\nadvances in quantum computing, gives one of these powers such an\\nasymmetrical advantage that mutually assured destruction would cease to\\nexist. Also, though of less importance, an impediment to \\x00ghting is the\\ninterlinked well-being of Americans and the Chinese in this highly\\ninterconnected world.\\nHowever, as time passes the risks increase. If the US continues to\\ndecline and China continues to rise, what matters most is whether or not\\neach can do so gracefully. The big risk is that when existential\\nirreconcilable di\\x00erences exist and there is no mutually agreed-upon\\nparty or process to adjudicate the con\\x00ict, there is a good chance that\\nthere will be a \\x00ght. As explained in the last chapter, the main seemingly\\nirreconcilable di\\x00erence between the US and China is over Taiwan, so I\\nam watching developments there very closely. Taiwan is a one-of-a-kind\\ninterest that China would \\x00ght for because of its belief that “there is but one\\nChina and Taiwan is part of China.” It is doubtful that the US would consider it\\nworth a major \\x00ght to defend, though it might. This seems to me to be the only\\npossible trigger for a military war between the two greatest powers in the next 10\\nyears.\\nThe next locations to pay attention to are the areas immediately around\\nChina, like those countries surrounding the East and South China Seas, and\\nother neighbors such as India, Russia, South Korea, North Korea, Japan,\\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, etc. Considering what China’s culture is like and what’s\\nmost bene\\x00cial for China, I believe it will work to in\\x00uence those countries\\nthrough an exchange of bene\\x00ts but won’t \\x00ght to control them outright.While the most important con\\x00icts are between the United States and\\nChina, there are other important players operating in this classic drama\\nof the balance of power and the prisoner’s dilemma. It is important to\\nwatch the actions of China’s and the United States’ allies and friends. As\\npreviously discussed, the alignments are gradually changing, with China gaining\\nallies and the United States losing them. Overextended and less willing to lose\\nlives \\x00ghting for others, the US is now in the position of trying to cat herd its\\nallies without catnip. In the past, the US merely needed to hint at what it wanted\\nother countries to do for them to do it. Now they go their own ways.\\nIn the end, which country wins the game of obtaining the most wealth and\\npower depends most on their internal capacities, which is why I monitor those\\nfactors in my indices as I do for military strength. As the Chinese know very well\\n(and it would be good for others to keep in mind), \\n the best way to ﬁght a war is to\\nget strong and show one’s opponent one’s strength so they don’t want to ﬁght violently . This\\nwill most likely be the dynamic that we see in the years ahead.\\nAll of this is to say that I think the odds favor intensifying\\ntrade/economic wars, technology wars, capital wars, and geopolitical wars\\nas China becomes even more competitive and increasingly goes global in\\nthese areas. As Graham Allison explained in his excellent book, Destined for\\nWar, in the past 500 years, when two nearly equal powers experienced\\nirreconcilable di\\x00erences, there were military wars in 12 out of 16 cases, and big\\nmilitary buildups were associated with major wars in 80–90 percent of cases.8 I\\nbalance those historical insights with the logic of mutually assured destruction,\\nwhich lowers the odds of war. On net, I would conclude that the probability of a\\nbig war in the next 10 years is 35 percent, give or take, which is essentially a wild\\nguess. In any case, it’s a dangerously high risk.\\nACTS OF NATURE\\nThroughout history, droughts, \\x00oods, pandemics, and other severe natural and\\nbiological disasters have in\\x00icted more harm on people than people havein\\x00icted on themselves, killing millions, disrupting economies, and contributing\\nto the falls of many empires and dynasties. This chart shows some of the major\\nevents.\\nWhile we all know about climate change, no one knows precisely how much\\ndamage and how many deaths it will ultimately cause. But based on expert\\nprojections, there is reason to believe that all of these kinds of disasters will be\\nbigger in the years ahead than they were before. While I’m no expert on the\\nsubject myself, I can show you some interesting stats and pass along what I’ve\\nlearned.\\nThe next chart on the right shows the world’s average temperature\\nand the amount of CO2, indicating global warming. There is little doubt\\nthis is happening, will pick up, and will have big and costly e\\x00ects. What\\nis notable is this is increasing at a faster rate. The chart on the left shows\\nthe very long-term perspective on temperature (since 0 CE).This chart captures extreme environmental events. The headline is\\nthat from 1970 to 2020 they increased from fewer than 50 per year to\\nnearly 200 per year and are trending higher.\\nThe next chart shows the estimated dollar cost of these events (adjusted for\\nin\\x00ation). As shown, this is also trending higher, with extreme spikes.\\nIt is pretty clear to me that humanity and natural evolution together\\nare doing great damage to the environment that will be very costly in\\nboth money and quality of life. This will a\\x00ect countries very di\\x00erently, in\\nways that we can broadly anticipate based on their locations, climates, and—\\nmost importantly—industries. At the same time, this is a slow, steady, and well-\\ntelegraphed change, which lends itself to the kind of adaptation and innovation\\nhumanity is uniquely able to do, though often too slowly and only in response\\nto pain. I am inclined to believe that slowly and reactively is how it will happen.\\nHaving said that, I don’t know enough about the subject to know what it means\\nfor every country and locality.\\nThe next chart shows an index of climate change vulnerability across\\nmajor countries based on an equal average of the Notre Dame-Global\\nAdaptation Index (ND-GAIN) Country Index, which quanti\\x00es a\\ncountry’s vulnerability to climate change, and academic estimates of the\\nfuture impact of climate change on GDP by country.\\nIN SUMMARY\\nBased on just these \\x00ve indicators, it appears to me that:\\nHumanity’s inventiveness will probably lead to great advances while\\nthe debt/economic cycle, the internal order cycle, the external order\\ncycle, and worsening acts of nature will almost certainly poseproblems. In other words, there will be a battle between humanity’s\\ninventiveness and these other challenges.\\nVery di\\x00erent conditions exist within and between countries, which\\nwill determine which countries will rise and decline and in what\\nways.\\nAll of this re\\x00ects my thinking about the future of the world’s 11 major\\ncountries based on just \\x00ve of the 18 determinants. Now let’s look at all 18\\nindicators to see what they tell us.\\nALL THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS ACROSS\\nTHE WORLD\\nThe following table paints a much richer picture of what’s happening and what\\nis likely to happen across the 11 major countries. While I have many of these\\nreadings for the top 20 countries, I don’t have the space to show them here; you\\ncan \\x00nd the complete set at economicprinciples.org. While this table might look\\nlike a bunch of numbers and arrows at \\x00rst glance, when you get into it a clearer\\npicture will emerge.\\nBut \\x00rst, here’s how to read the table and how these gauges work. The\\n\\x00rst column shows the determinant being measured. The second rates\\nthe quality of the gauge. It is provided because for some of these important\\ndeterminants we have good, clear measurements (e.g., for education, innovation\\nand technology, cost competitiveness, productivity and output growth) and for\\nsome we don’t (e.g., acts of nature), and I want to show which is which.\\nAdditionally, there are other determinants that aren’t shown because they are\\neither too subjective or too di\\x00cult to quantify (e.g., leadership). The quality of\\nleadership can’t be measured as objectively as the amount of economic output\\n(e.g., how can you measure whether Donald Trump was a good leader or a bad\\none?). Each is an aggregate of many indicators that I combined in the way that I\\nfelt best captured that particular determinant, giving consideration to bothquantity and quality. For example, a country with a large population like China,\\nIndia, and the United States when compared to a country with a small\\npopulation like Singapore, the Netherlands, and Switzerland might have more\\nof something but of lesser quality. I tried to structure these weightings so that I\\ncould imagine who would win if they had a competition like the Olympics or a\\nwar.\\nCURREN T READINGS A CROSS M AJOR POWERS\\n(Z-Scor e and 20-Y ear Change Denoted b y Arr ows)\\n\\xa0 Gauge\\nQualityUSA CHN EUR DEU\\nEMPIRE SCORE (0–1) \\xa0 0.87\\n 0.75\\n 0.55\\n 0.37\\nDebt Bur den (Big E conomic\\nCycle)Good -1.8\\n 0.3\\n -0.3\\n 1.6\\nExpected Gr owth (Big E conomic\\nCycle)Good -0.7\\n 0.4\\n -1.0\\n -1.0\\nInternal Conﬂict (Internal Or der;\\nlow is bad)Good -2.0\\n 0.2\\n 0.4\\n 0.7\\nEducation Good 2.0\\n 1.6\\n 0.3\\n -0.2\\nInno vation & T echnology Good 2.0\\n 1.5\\n 0.4\\n -0.1\\nCost Competitiv eness Good -0.4\\n 1.2\\n -0.6\\n -0.6\\nMilitar y Str ength Good 1.9\\n 1.0\\n 0.3\\n -0.6\\nTrade Good 1.1\\n 1.8\\n 1.3\\n 0.6\\nEconomic Output Good 1.7\\n 1.8\\n 0.6\\n -0.1\\nMark ets & Financial Center Good 2.6\\n 0.5\\n 0.4\\n -0.2\\nReser ve Curr ency Status (0–1) Good 0.55\\n 0.04\\n 0.23\\n \\xa0 \\xa0\\nGeology Good 1.4\\n 0.9\\n -0.4\\n -0.7\\nResour ce-Allocation Eﬃciency OK 1.3\\n 0.0\\n -0.8 \\xa0 0.6\\nActs of Natur e OK -0.2 \\xa0-0.1 \\xa0 0.0 \\xa0 1.1 \\xa0\\nInfrastructur e & Inv estment Good 0.7\\n 2.7\\n 0.2\\n -0.3\\nChar acter/Civility/Determination OK 1.1\\n 1.5\\n -1.0\\n -0.5\\nGovernance/Rule of Law Good 0.7\\n -0.7\\n -0.4 \\xa0 0.7\\nGaps in W ealth, Oppor tunity &\\nValuesOK -1.6\\n -0.4\\n 0.3\\n 0.7\\nScanning the table, you can quickly get a picture of each country’s\\ncircumstances and the overall state of the world.

I \\x00nd this data invaluable. It’s crucial to watch for changes in it\\nwhen thinking about what’s happening and what is likely to happen.\\n\\xa0 Gauge\\nQualityJPN IND GBR FRA\\nEMPIRE SCORE (0–1) \\xa0 0.30\\n 0.27\\n 0.27\\n 0.25\\nDebt Bur den (Big E conomic\\nCycle)Good -0.4\\n 0.1\\n -1.6\\n -0.8\\nExpected Gr owth (Big E conomic\\nCycle)Good -1.1\\n 1.1\\n -0.8\\n -0.9\\nInternal Conﬂict (Internal Or der;\\nlow is bad)Good 1.1\\n \\xa0 \\xa0-0.3\\n -0.1\\nEducation Good 0.2\\n -1.2\\n -0.2\\n -0.5\\nInno vation & T echnology Good 0.2\\n -1.2\\n -0.3\\n -0.5\\nCost Competitiv eness Good -0.3\\n 2.4\\n -0.3\\n -0.6\\nMilitar y Str ength Good -0.1\\n 0.2\\n -0.3\\n -0.3\\nTrade Good -0.5\\n -0.8\\n -0.6\\n -0.5\\nEconomic Output Good -0.3\\n -0.2\\n -0.3\\n -0.5\\nMark ets & Financial Center Good 0.1\\n -0.8\\n 0.0\\n -0.3\\nReser ve Curr ency Status (0–1) Good 0.07\\n 0.0 \\xa00.07\\n \\xa0 \\xa0\\nGeology Good -1.1\\n 0.3\\n -0.9\\n -0.5\\nResour ce-Allocation Eﬃciency OK 0.1\\n 0.2 \\xa0 0.3\\n -1.3\\nActs of Natur e OK 1.5 \\xa0-2.4 \\xa0 0.4 \\xa0 0.0 \\xa0\\nInfrastructur e & Inv estment Good -0.2\\n -0.3\\n -0.6\\n -0.2\\nChar acter/Civility/Determination OK 0.5\\n 1.3\\n -0.4\\n -1.5\\nGovernance/Rule of Law Good 0.8\\n -1.1\\n 1.2\\n 0.3\\nGaps in W ealth, Oppor tunity &\\nValuesOK 0.9\\n -1.8\\n -0.2\\n 1.1\\n\\xa0 Gauge\\nQualityNLD RUS ESP\\nEMPIRE SCORE (0–1) \\xa0 0.25\\n 0.23\\n 0.20\\nDebt Bur den (Big E conomic\\nCycle)Good 0.8\\n 1.0\\n -1.7\\nExpected Gr owth (Big E conomic\\nCycle)Good -0.8 \\xa0 -0.2 \\xa0 -1.1\\nInternal Conﬂict (Internal Or der;\\nlow is bad)Good 1.2\\n -0.5\\n -0.4\\nEducation Good -0.7\\n -0.5\\n -0.9\\nInno vation & T echnology Good -0.3\\n -0.7\\n -1.0\\nCost Competitiv eness Good -0.8\\n 0.7 \\xa0 -0.6\\nMilitar y Str ength Good -1.9\\n 0.4\\n -0.8\\nTrade Good -0.6\\n -0.9\\n -0.9\\nEconomic Output Good -0.3\\n -1.4\\n -0.9\\nMark ets & Financial Center Good -0.5\\n -1.1\\n -0.6\\nReser ve Curr ency Status (0–1) Good \\xa0 \\xa0 0.0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nGeology Good -0.5\\n 1.9\\n -0.6\\nResour ce-Allocation Eﬃciency OK -0.1\\n 1.3 \\xa0 -1.6\\nActs of Natur e OK 0.5 \\xa0 -0.1 \\xa0 -0.7 \\xa0\\nInfrastructur e & Inv estment Good -0.4\\n -1.0\\n -0.6\\nChar acter/Civility/Determination OK -0.3\\n 0.1 \\xa0 -1.0\\nGovernance/Rule of Law Good 1.0\\n -1.9\\n -0.7\\nGaps in W ealth, Oppor tunity &\\nValuesOK 0.6\\n \\xa0 \\xa0 0.4\\nFor example, as shown before, when 1) a country’s \\x00nances are\\ndeteriorating at the same time as 2) the level of internal con\\x00ict is high\\n(e.g., over wealth and/or values di\\x00erences), while 3) the country is being\\nchallenged by one or more strong foreign rivals, that typically produces\\n4) a mutually and self-reinforcing decline. That’s because the country’s\\ndeteriorating \\x00nances make it impossible for it to satisfy domestic\\nspending needs and \\x00nance the war, which causes worse outcomes.\\nNow that these things are quanti\\x00ed, we can see them happening in the table\\nand make projections. The greater the number of important determinants that\\nare worsening and the more severely they are worsening, the surer and more\\nsevere the decline will be. For example, if a few other determinants are weak and\\nweakening at the same time that others are faltering, the expected severity of the\\ndecline increases. Because I, with the help of my computer, can monitor such\\nthings, I can assess a country’s relative health, vulnerabilities, and future\\nprospects. For example, many of the most worrying conditions now exist in the\\nUnited States, even though the United States is still the most powerful country\\nin the world. That merits close attention.\\nAs conveyed in some earlier charts, we saw that 1) these determinants tend\\nto reinforce each other, whether in strength (e.g., stronger education\\ntends to create stronger incomes) or weakness (e.g., weakening trade\\nleads to higher indebtedness), so they tend to transpire in cycles that\\ncome together to create the Big Cycle, and 2) when the determinants are\\nweak and weakening, the empires are weak and weakening.9 Big swings\\nup occur when lots of determinants are strengthening and big swings\\ndown occur when lots of determinants are weakening.\\nOur computers use this data to generate written reports, which are\\navailable to read at economicprinciples.org. They project real GDP\\ngrowth rates for the next 10 years, along with the gauge readings for\\neach factor that leads to those estimates. The data, and hence theprojections, is more reliable for some countries than others, which is conveyed in\\nthe readouts. Still, they do a good job of re\\x00ecting the current health of a\\ncountry and serve as leading indicators of their future health. Based on\\nbacktesting, these estimates would have predicted a country’s average growth\\nrate over the next decade within 1 percent of the actual growth 59 percent of the\\ntime, and within 2 percent about 90 percent of the time, with a correlation to\\nsubsequent growth of 81 percent. I have found them to be invaluable.\\nWhile these are good and useful indicators, they have to work hand in hand\\nwith my thinking. Consider the question, “What is the mix of powers that\\nmakes a country powerful?” While the total power index at the top of the\\ncurrent readings tables is intended to indicate that and is arrived at via a\\nweighted average of the indices below it, the truth is that the type of power that\\nis most important to have at any one time varies according to circumstances. For\\nexample, military power is expensive and it typically sits around doing nothing\\nuntil it is the most important power to have. How do I properly weight that\\nagainst economic output that consists of mostly nonessentials? The answer is\\nnot well. I don’t have it modeled well, but I think about it a lot and apply my\\nexperience and intuition to it. In time I will have it modeled better, but I know\\nthat I will always need to have what is in my head work with what’s in the\\ncomputer, as the computer and I need each other to be at our best.\\nTHE NEXT 10 YEARSWhile this book is about the really big cycles, I’d like to focus now on\\nthe dynamics within these cycles that will be most important over the\\nnext 10 years. As I’ve explained, there are cycles within cycles within cycles,\\nwith the little ones adding up to the bigger ones, plus there are non-cyclical\\nbumps that all together determine what happens. Over the next 10 years, the\\nmost important dynamics are the short-term debt/money/economy cycle\\n(also called the business cycle), the internal political cycle, and the\\nescalating con\\x00icts/reducing interdependencies between the US and\\nChina. I \\x00nd that keeping these cycles in mind, thinking about how they a\\x00ect\\neach other, and assessing where things stand within them are helpful for timing\\nmy decisions.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 4, the short-term debt/money/economic cycle\\nconsists of alternating periods of central banks stimulating the economy by\\ncreating money and credit and then attempting to slowing it down by reducing\\nthe \\x00ow of them. They never get this precisely right, which is what produces the\\nexcesses that lead to bubbles, busts, and the cycle beginning again. Sometimes\\nother negative events happen around the same time as a downturn—September\\n11, 2001 was such a case.\\nThis cycle typically takes about eight years, give or take a few, though the\\ntiming is less the result of how long it’s been since the last one and more the\\nresult of the underlying economic drivers themselves. Most importantly, the\\namount of slack in the economy, the amounts and types of \\x00nancial bubbles, the\\namount of central bank tightening, and the markets’ and economies’ sensitivity\\nto tightening all matter. The last cycle began in April 2020 with largest dose of\\n\\x00scal and monetary stimulation ever. The one before that began in 2008, which\\nwas also a giant dose though much less big. The ones before that began in 2001,\\n1990, 1982, 1980, 1974, 1970, 1960, etc. With the amounts of stimulation\\ninjected into this recent downturn being so enormous (especially in the US),\\nwith the slack in the major economies being relatively limited (especially in the\\nUS), with the signs of bubbles now being moderate to strong, and with the\\ninterest rate sensitivity of markets and the economy being high, my guess is that\\nthe next downturn will come sooner than is typical. I’d estimate in about fouryears from the publication of this book, give or take a couple of years (which is\\nabout \\x00ve-and-a-half years from the bottom).\\nDon’t bet on what I just said happening because that con\\x00guration is not\\nprecise. I will need to monitor the factors I just mentioned, especially the rate of\\nrebound in in\\x00ation and how quick and strong central bank tightening will be\\nin order to home in on the precise timing. Also, I would expect any downturn to\\nbe promptly followed by a quick reversal of central bank policies toward the next\\nbig round of stimulation. That makes me less worried about the impact of the\\ndownturn and more worried about the excess money printing and the loss of\\nvalue of money (particularly cash and debt in dollars, euros, and yen). Of course\\nwhat happens in this economic cycle will be a\\x00ected by what happens with the\\nother cycles and the bumps along the way, just as this cycle will a\\x00ect the other\\ncycles.\\nAs far as the internal order/disorder cycle is concerned, it typically lags the\\ndebt/economic cycle because people are less confrontational in good times than\\nin bad ones. When these cycles interact strongly, it can lead to major changes. In\\nthe US the short-term political cycles of change come every two years with\\ncongressional elections and every four years with presidential elections, with an\\neight-year limit on the total presidential term. In China the changes come every\\n\\x00ve and 10 years with the next big one happening around the time of this book’s\\npublication (November 2021). There is no limit on the presidential term. While\\nwe can look at the calendars and know something about what’s ahead, there will\\nbe lots of uncertainties, some of which can be really impactful. Based on my\\nestimates, there is a signi\\x00cant chance the next downturn will come around the\\ntime of the next presidential election in the US.\\nThe external order/disorder cycle has traditionally followed the path of\\naccelerating con\\x00icts that lead to wars. As mentioned earlier, the United States\\nand China are now preparing themselves for increasing intensity in the \\x00ve types\\nof war. They are operating with roughly \\x00ve-year plans to gain greater amounts\\nof self-su\\x00ciency and preparedness for each of these wars, which will give them\\ngreater ability to wage them, though it’s doubtful that either will become\\ndominant enough to ignore the deterrent of mutually assured destruction. Since\\nChina’s strength is gaining relative to that of the US, it would seem to imply thatimportant changes will come neither too soon nor too far ahead. As mentioned\\nearlier, there is signi\\x00cant risk that we are approaching a con\\x00ict between an\\nunstoppable force and an immovable object regarding Taiwan and the East and\\nSouth China Seas—i.e., China is an unstoppable force for change to Taiwan’s\\ncurrent status and the United States is an immovable object against it. Beyond\\nthe US and China, other nations—mo st notably Russia, India, Japan, Korea,\\nand the key European and Middle Eastern powers—w ill play important roles in\\nthis global drama. Over the next \\x00ve years or so, alliances are likely to harden.\\nThese things point toward the next big risk point being around \\x00ve\\nyears from this writing, give or take a couple of years.\\nTo reiterate, there is nothing precise about the timing of these cycles.\\nThey’re like hurricane/typhoon seasons; we know they are likely to happen at\\nroughly certain times so we prepare for them, and when those times come, we\\nwatch for storms emerging, follow them closely, and do our best to get out of\\nharm’s way. While we can’t say exactly when they will come and exactly how\\nstrong they will be, we do know that the trend and the fundamentals have been\\nfor them to get stronger, so we should be prepared for that possibility.\\nDespite all the analytical work I do, I know that the unknown is still much\\ngreater than the known. While history can be told pretty precisely, the future is\\nexactly the opposite. I am not aware of a single case of the future being foretold\\naccurately in any detail. For an investor, understanding history accurately is of\\nno use relative to being a bit more right than wrong about the future. Since non-\\ninvestors place bets in the form of their life decisions, that’s true for them too.\\nThat brings me to the \\x00nal point of this chapter, which is about knowing how\\nto place one’s bets based on the assumption that one is likely to be wrong a lot.\\nDEALING WITH WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT\\nYOU DON’T KNOW\\nWhatever success I’ve had has been more due to my knowing how to deal with\\nwhat I don’t know than anything I know. Betting on the future is betting onprobabilities and nothing is certain, not even the probabilities. That’s just the\\nway it is. While what I’ve given you up until this point is what I believe I know\\nabout the future based on my reasoning about the past, what I want to pass\\nalong that is probably more important is how I make decisions in life and in the\\nmarkets based on what I don’t know. In a nutshell, here’s what I try to do:\\n Know all the possibilities, think about the worst-case scenarios, and then ﬁnd ways to\\neliminate the int olerable ones . Identifying and eliminating the intolerable worst-case\\nscenarios comes \\x00rst. That’s because the most important thing in playing the\\ngame (of life or the markets) is to not get knocked out of it. I learned that from a\\nbig mistake I made in 1982, which nearly broke me. After that painful loss I\\ncalculated what my basic needs would cost and worked toward having enough\\nmoney stashed away so my worst-case scenario would be tolerable. As I built up\\nfrom nothing, I remember regularly calculating how many weeks, then months,\\nand then years my family and I would be \\x00ne if not another dime came in. I now\\nhave an “end of the world” portfolio that I know will keep us \\x00ne in the worst-\\ncase scenarios, and I build from there. From reading this book, you can probably\\nsee that I imagine a lot of worst-case scenarios, including depressions,\\ndevaluations, revolutions, wars, pandemics, my big mistakes, health problems,\\nand death from di\\x00erent causes. I start by trying to protect myself against all of\\nthem and more. While you might think that my paying so much attention to\\neliminating worst-case scenarios is depressing and prevents me from making the\\nmost of opportunities, the opposite is true. It’s liberating and exciting to operate\\nthis way because knowing that the worst-case scenarios are covered gives me the\\nsafety, freedom, and ability to go for great results.\\n Diversify . In addition to making sure I’ve covered all the worst-case scenarios\\nI can think of, I try to cover those I can’t think of by diversifying well. I learned\\nthe math of it and I’m drawn to it instinctively. Essentially, if I have a bunch of\\nbets that are attractive but unrelated, I can reduce my risks by up to 80 percent\\nwithout reducing my upside at all. While this sounds like an investment strategy\\nit’s actually an old and well-established good life strategy that I apply to\\ninvestments as well. There is a Chinese saying that “a smart rabbit has three\\nburrows,” meaning three places to go to in case any one of them becomesdangerous. This principle has saved many people’s lives when things got bad,\\nand it’s one of my most important principles.\\n Put deferred gratiﬁcation ahead of immediate gratiﬁcation so you will be better off in\\nthe futur e.\\n Triangulate among the smar test peop le possible.  I tag along with the smartest\\npeople I can \\x00nd, so I can stress test my thinking and learn from them.\\nIt is through these principles that I got so much upside with relatively little\\ndownside and a steadily improving future, albeit with bumps along the way.\\nThat’s why I recommend these principles to you, though as always, you should\\nfeel free to take them or leave them as you like.\\nOne more thing for policy makers, those they report to, and others who are\\ninterested:\\nUse the gauges I gave you, or take the stats and make your own, to 1) measure\\nthe health of your country and other countries you’re interested in, 2) see if it is\\nimproving or worsening and in what ways, and 3) make changes in the\\ndeterminants of the future to get a better future.\\nThat’s it.\\nI now feel that doing all this has given me an adequate understanding of the\\npossibilities, both worst-case scenarios and opportunities, and a time-tested plan\\nfor dealing with them well. I also believe that I have adequately conveyed to you\\nin this book and on economicprinciples.org the most important things I know\\nabout how the lessons of the past can help you deal with the future. I hope you\\n\\x00nd them to be of some use. I plan to evolve all of this to make it better, which I\\nhope we can do together.\\nMay the Force of Evolution be with you,\\nMORE DETAIL ON EACH OF THE GAUGES\\nEducation: This gauge measures basic and higher education, split about\\nevenly between the two. Half of the measure captures the absolute quantity\\nof educated people at various levels and about half is placed on quality such\\nas higher education rankings, test scores, and average years of education.\\nThe US ranks highest in this gauge (driven by strong absolute and relative\\nmeasures of higher education), with China close behind (due to its large\\nnumber of educated people).\\nInnovation & Technology: This gauge measures inventiveness,\\ntechnological advancement, and entrepreneurship. It gives about half its\\nweight to the country’s absolute share of key innovation metrics (e.g.,\\npatents, researchers, R&D spending, and venture capital funding) and half\\nto a combination of external rankings and measures of innovation per\\ncapita (to help capture how widespread innovation is in the economy). The\\nUS is at the top of this measure due to its strength across a variety of\\nmetrics, while China ranks second due to its large share of global research\\nspending, researchers, and patents. China is rising quickly in this area.\\nCost Competitiveness: This gauge measures what one gets for what one\\npays. We want to see this because countries that produce the best at costs\\nthat are too expensive aren’t in good shape, even though they rank high in\\nquality. We look at quality-adjusted and productivity-adjusted labor costs,\\nalong with other productivity measures. Major developing economies\\n(particularly India) rank highest in this gauge, while the US ranks around\\nthe middle of the pack and European countries rank lowest (due to high\\nlabor costs).\\nInfrastructure & Investment: This gauge measures the quantity of\\ninfrastructure and investment spending and the quality of it. It captures a\\ncountry’s absolute share of global investment, as well as the extent to which\\na country prioritizes quality of infrastructure and productivity-enhancinginvestments. The gauge weighs measures of investment as a share of world\\ninvestment, overall infrastructure quality, investment and savings as a share\\nof GDP, and logistics performance. China is currently the strongest\\naccording to this gauge (having risen sharply over the past 20 years) because\\nof its high rates of productive investment relative to both the world and the\\nsize of its own past investment; the US is second, due largely to its high\\nshare of global productive investment, though it is worsening.\\nEconomic Output: This gauge measures the strength of a country’s\\neconomic resources. We measure output primarily through GDP levels as a\\nshare of world total (adjusted for price di\\x00erences across countries). We\\nallocate some weight to GDP per capita rather than total GDP to capture\\nquality. China ranks \\x00rst in this gauge, insigni\\x00cantly ahead of the US but\\nalso rising fastest, due its large PPP-adjusted GDP share. Europe ranks\\nthird.\\nExpected Growth (Big Economic Cycle): This gauge measures how well\\na country is positioned to grow its economy over the next 10 years. We look\\nat a variety of metrics to estimate forward-looking 10-year economic\\ngrowth, placing two-thirds weight on metrics that predict productivity and\\none-third on metrics that predict the impact of indebtedness on growth.\\nCurrently India is predicted to grow the fastest, followed by China, with\\nthe US predicted to grow a bit slower than average, and with Japan and a\\nnumber of European countries predicted to grow least.\\nTrade: This gauge measures how strong of an exporter a country is. It\\nlooks at the absolute level of a country’s exports as a share of the world.\\nChina scores highest (being the largest exporter in the world), followed by\\nEurope and the US.\\nMilitary Strength: This gauge is driven mostly by the absolute share of\\nmilitary spending and strength measured by the number of personnel, the\\nnumber of nuclear weapons, and external indices of military capabilities. It\\ndoes not look at military powers in varying regions or of various types,\\nfailing to capture some military superiorities Russia and China have in\\ncertain geographic areas, certain types of military technologies, or the role\\nof alliances. The US is still the strongest overall military power based onthese measures, with a strong lead in spending and a nuclear weapons\\nprogram that is only rivaled by Russia. China is now ranked second and is\\nrising quickly.\\nFinancial Center: This gauge measures the level of development and sizes\\nof a country’s \\x00nancial markets and \\x00nancial center. We look at absolute\\nmeasures of transaction shares and market capitalizations, as well as\\nexternal indices of \\x00nancial center cities. The US remains the top-ranked\\npower in this metric by a signi\\x00cant margin (driven primarily by its very\\nlarge share of world equity and debt markets), with China and Europe\\nranking second and third, respectively.\\nReserve Currency Status: This gauge measures the extent to which a\\ncountry’s currency operates as a global reserve currency. We measure reserve\\ncurrency status by the share of transactions, debts, and central bank\\nreserves that are denominated or held in a country’s currency. Similar to\\n\\x00nancial center status, the US remains the top-ranked power in this metric\\nby a signi\\x00cant margin, with Europe and Japan ranking second and third,\\nrespectively.\\nDebt Burden (Big Economic Cycle): This gauge is based on a\\ncombination of a) debt levels relative to asset levels, b) the sizes of external\\nand internal surpluses and de\\x00cits, c) the sizes of debt service costs relative\\nto GDP, d) the amount of debt in a country’s own currency versus foreign\\ncurrency, e) the amount of debt held by its own citizens versus foreigners,\\nand f) its credit rating. We composed it this way because it has proven itself\\nto be the most reliable way we have of foreshadowing declines in the value\\nof real wealth, whether they come in the form of debt defaults that result\\nfrom not creating enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs\\nor devaluations that come from creating more than enough money and\\ncredit to satisfy excessive debt needs. I constructed this index to exclude\\nreserve currency status so that I could see the exposure a country would\\nhave if it lost its reserve currency status.\\nInternal Con\\x00ict (Internal Order): This gauge looks at how much\\ndomestic con\\x00ict and discontent there is. It measures actual con\\x00ict events\\n(e.g., protests), political con\\x00ict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent(based on surveys). The US ranks highest in this gauge among the major\\ncountries, driven by measures of partisanship and higher incidence of\\ninternal con\\x00ict events, and it has been rising fast.\\nGovernance/Rule of Law: This gauge measures the extent to which a\\ncountry’s legal system is consistent, predictable, and conducive to growth\\nand advancement. It combines rule of law measures (based primarily on\\nbusiness surveys of doing business in the country) and corruption measures\\n(via a combination of external corruption indices and surveys of\\nbusinesses). Russia and India score lowest (worst) on the gauge, while the\\nUK, the Netherlands, and Japan score highest (best), with Germany and\\nthe US close behind.\\nGeology: This gauge measures each country’s geographic endowment,\\nincluding land size and the value of its natural resources. It includes the\\ntotal production of energy, agriculture, and industrial metals in order to\\ncapture the absolute production capacity of each nation, as well as net\\nexports to capture relative self-reliance for each of the categories (in\\naddition to measuring some other natural resources like freshwater supply).\\nRussia and the US score highest (followed by China, which relies more on\\nthe rest of the world to cover its natural resource needs), while Japan and\\nthe UK score lowest.\\nGaps in Wealth, Opportunity & Values: This gauge measures how big\\nthe gaps in wealth/income, opportunities, and values are. It combines\\nmeasures of both a) wealth and income inequality (e.g., how much does the\\ntop 1 percent have versus the rest) and b) political con\\x00ict (e.g., how split is\\nthe legislature on ideology). India, the US, and China score worst because\\nof very large wealth and income gaps (and in the case of the US also\\nsigni\\x00cant political gaps). At the other end of the spectrum are the\\nEuropean nations and Japan, which generally speaking have lower income\\nand wealth inequality.\\nCharacter/Civility/Determination: This gauge attempts to measure to\\nwhat extent the attitudes of each country’s people create an environment\\nthat’s supportive to civility and hard work, which supports growth and\\nadvancement. It uses a) surveys around attitudes toward working hard andsuccess and b) other measures that proxy how much a society values self-\\nsu\\x00ciency and work (e.g., government transfer payments size, e\\x00ective\\nretirement age) to quantify this. China and India score highest (the US is\\nthird), and the European countries (notably Spain and France) score\\nlowest.\\nResource-Allocation E\\x00ciency: This gauge attempts to measure how\\ne\\x00ciently each country is using its labor and capital. It looks at whether the\\ncountry has chronically high unemployment (i.e., not \\x00nding e\\x00cient ways\\nto employ its people), if debt growth generates commensurate income\\ngrowth over time, and external indices and surveys about the rigidity of the\\nlabor market and ease of getting loans. Much of Europe (particularly\\nFrance and Spain) score lowest on these measures, while the US and\\nGermany score near the top. Developing countries (particularly Russia, but\\nalso China and India) also score fairly well in this measure—as generally\\nspeaking they produce more income growth per unit of debt growth.\\nActs of Nature: This gauge measures how vulnerable to and impacted by\\nacts of nature each country is. While it is di\\x00cult to quantify all the various\\nacts of nature that might a\\x00ect a country, we used expert assessments of\\nfuture climate change impact on each country’s GDP, external assessments\\nof each country’s preparedness for natural disasters, and the outcomes\\nfrom the COVID pandemic (as that was a real-time test against an act of\\nnature). I consider this rating so-so and \\x00nd that there is still a lot more we\\nwant to capture to make this gauge better, hence its low quality.\\nExternal Con\\x00ict: While not a part of the model for individual countries,\\nthe external con\\x00ict gauge measures the levels of economic,\\npolitical/cultural, and military con\\x00ict between pairs of major countries.\\nWithin each category, we tried to come up with a mix of structural\\nindicators (to establish a baseline level of con\\x00ict between countries) and\\ntimely indicators (to \\x00ag major escalations above that baseline). For\\nexample, for economic con\\x00ict we track bilateral trade between countries,\\ntari\\x00 rates, and timely news around sanctions, trade wars, etc.1 Importantly, a number of the charts shown on these pages rely on the record from fewer countries further\\nin the past, due to limited reliable data history. Life expectancy prior to the 1800s is solely based on Great\\nBritain (marked by the dotted line). Global RGDP is primarily a mix of European countries before 1870.\\nAnd there are not good records of total wealth prior to the 1900s, so I can’t show you the picture before\\nthen.\\n2 Soon not being able to read and write computer code will be like not being able to read and write words.\\n3 Arrows denote the 20-year change in the gauge.\\n4 As a result, debt assets (especially cash) will probably perform poorly and debt liabilities will probably be\\ngood to have, especially if invested in pro\\x00table, disruptive technologies and solid investments that have\\nhigher returns than the cost of funding them.\\n5 Individual European countries are not shown on the reserve currency status gauge due to the European\\nMonetary Union (all these countries use the euro)—so only the Europe aggregate is shown. The measure\\nshows an average of what share of global transactions, debts, and o\\x00cial central bank reserve holdings are\\ndenominated in each country’s currency.\\n6 In 1919, over 20 percent of the US labor force went on strike.\\n7 There have been just over 50 wars between great powers since 1500, per Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels\\nof Our Nature (2011). Eighty percent of the years before 1800 had wars; it’s been 20 percent since.\\n8 We may be seeing such a buildup now. China’s military spending has risen sharply in dollar terms over the\\npast decade, though as a share of GDP it remains relatively steady (at around 2 percent). At around 3\\npercent of GDP, military spending has fallen a bit for the US.\\n9 Determinants like geology (i.e., minerals in the ground) are relatively easy to measure, though the\\nimplications of having them might change. Determinants that evolve like humanity’s innovations and\\ntechnologies can typically be seen emerging by watching the trends. Those that transpire in cycles (like debt\\nand capital markets) can be understood by understanding the cycles. The fact that acts of nature like\\npandemics, droughts, and \\x00oods come along shouldn’t be a surprise, though their timing often is.APPENDIX\\nCOMPUTER ANALYSIS OF THE\\nCONDITIONS OF, AND PROSPECTS FOR,\\nTHE WORLD’S LEADING COUNTRIES\\nAs I described earlier, I feed data into a computer that can create an output\\nsummarizing the conditions of, and long-term prospects for, the world’s leading\\ncountries. These computer-generated summaries follow on the next few pages. I\\nuse these outputs to supplement my own thinking and other computer models I\\nrun to help me understand the world. This system is a never-ending work in\\nprogress. I will update these summaries on economicprinciples.org at least\\nannually or more frequently if any big changes take place.\\nThe text for each country highlights a few of the major gauges and a few of\\nthe stats within each gauge that re\\x00ect the broad trends we are seeing. The\\naggregate gauges and \\x00nal country power score I am showing include hundreds\\nof individual stats that we aggregate based on relevance, quality, and consistency\\nacross countries and time. To best capture the overall strength of a country, I\\ngave considerations to both quantity and quality, but structured things to best\\ncapture who would win in a competition or war.THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF THE\\nUNITED STATES\\nThis is our computer-generated reading for the United States as of\\nAugust 2021.\\nBased on the latest readings of key indicators, the United States appears to be\\na strong power (No. 1 among major countries today) in gradual decline.\\nAs shown in the table, the key strengths of the United States that put it\\nin this position are its strong capital markets and \\x00nancial center, its\\ninnovation/technology, its high level of education, its strong military, its\\nreserve currency status, and its high economic output. Its weaknesses are\\nits unfavorable economic/\\x00nancial position and its large domestic\\ncon\\x00icts. The eight major measures of power are very strong today but are, in\\naggregate, trending downward. In particular, the United States’ relative position\\nin education, its importance to global trade, and its relative military strength are\\ndeclining.\\nThe table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as\\nwell as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and\\nthe trajectory over the past 20 years.\\nTo understand a country, we start by looking at the big cycles, as well as\\nmeasures of power that both re\\x00ect and drive the rise and fall of a country.\\nWhile we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact\\nwith and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.\\nFor the United States, the big cycles look unfavorable.The United States is in an unfavorable position in its economic and\\n\\x00nancial cycles, with a high debt burden and relatively low expected real\\ngrowth over the next 10 years (1.1 percent per year). The United States has\\nsigni\\x00cantly more foreign debts than foreign assets (net IIP is -64 percent of\\nGDP). Non-\\x00nancial debt levels are high (277 percent of GDP), and\\ngovernment debt levels are high (128 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts\\n(99 percent) are in its own currency, which mitigates its debt risks. The ability to\\nuse interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is low (short rates at 0.1 percent),\\nand the country is already printing money to monetize debt. That said, being\\nthe world’s leading reserve currency is extremely bene\\x00cial to the US. If this were\\nto change, it would signi\\x00cantly weaken the US position.\\nUNITED ST ATES—KEY DRIVERS OF OUR COUN TRY POWER SCORE\\nOverall Empir e Scor e (0–1) Level: 0.87 \\xa0 Rank: 1\\nThe Big Cy cles Level Z-Scor e Rank Traject ory\\nEconomic/Financial P osition Unfa vorable -1.7 10\\nDebt Bur den High Debt -1.8 11\\nExpected Gr owth 1.1% -0.7 4\\nInternal Or der High Risk -1.8 11\\nWealth/Oppor tunity/V alues Gap Large -1.6 9\\nInternal Conﬂict Very High -2.0 10\\nExternal Or der At Risk \\xa0 \\xa0\\nEight K ey Measur es of P ower \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nMark ets & Financial Center Very Str ong 2.6 1\\nInno vation & T echnology Very Str ong 2.0 1\\nEducation Very Str ong 2.0 1\\nMilitar y Str ength Very Str ong 1.9 1\\nReser ve Curr ency Status Very Str ong 1.7 1\\nEconomic Output Very Str ong 1.7 2\\nTrade Strong 1.1 3\\nCost Competitiv eness Average -0.4 6\\nAdditional Measur es of P ower \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Overall Empir e Scor e (0–1) Level: 0.87 \\xa0 Rank: 1\\nThe Big Cy cles Level Z-Scor e Rank Traject ory\\nGeology Strong 1.4 2\\nResour ce-Allocation Eﬃciency Strong 1.3 2\\nInfrastructur e & Inv estment Strong 0.7 2\\nChar acter/Determination/Civility Strong 1.1 3\\nGovernance/Rule of Law Strong 0.7 5\\nActs of Natur e Average -0.2 9 \\xa0\\n Getting better\\u2003\\n  Getting worse\\u2003\\n  Flat\\nInternal disorder is a high risk.

The United States also has the strongest position\\nin education among major countries. The United States has a large share of\\nthe world’s bachelor’s degrees (20 percent). On years of education, the UnitedStates is good—students have on average 13.7 years of education versus 11.5 in\\nthe average major country. PISA scores, which measure the pro\\x00ciency of 15-\\nyear-old students across countries, are around average—495 versus 483 in the\\naverage major country.

As shown in\\nthe table, the key strengths of China that put it in this position are its\\nstrong economic and \\x00nancial position, its infrastructure and\\ninvestment, its importance to global trade, its high economic output, its\\npeople’s self-su\\x00ciency and strong work ethic, its high level of education,\\nand its strong military.

China has slightly more foreign assets thanforeign debts (net IIP is 12 percent of GDP). Non-\\x00nancial debt levels are high\\n(263 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are low (48 percent of\\nGDP). The bulk of these debts (96 percent) are in its own currency, which\\nmitigates its debt risks.

Its weaknesses are its large domestic con\\x00icts, its weak relative\\nposition in education, its bad reading on innovation and technology, its\\ncorruption and inconsistent rule of law, and its lack of reserve currency\\nstatus. The eight major measures of power are somewhat strong today and are,\\nin aggregate, trending upward. In particular, India’s relative military strength, its\\ninnovation and technology, and its importance to global trade are increasing.\\nThe table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as\\nwell as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and\\nthe trajectory over the past 20 years.\\nTo understand a country, we start by looking at the big cycles, as well as\\nmeasures of power that both re\\x00ect and drive the rise and fall of a country.\\nWhile we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact\\nwith and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.\\nFor India, the big cycles look mixed.\\nIndia is in a highly favorable position in its economic and \\x00nancial cycles,\\nwith a moderately low debt burden and high expected real growth over the next\\n10 years (6.3 percent per year). India has slightly more foreign debts than foreignassets (net IIP is -12 percent of GDP). Non-\\x00nancial debt levels are low (125\\npercent of GDP), though government debt levels are typical for major countries\\ntoday (75 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts (91 percent) are in its own\\ncurrency, which mitigates its debt risks.
